ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
ðŸŽ¯ Aim
The goal of this project is to build a scalable, secure, and well-governed data pipeline to process customer review data using Azure Data Lake Storage, Unity Catalog, and Databricks. The pipeline ingests raw review data, transforms and cleans it in Databricks using PySpark, and stores the processed data in a structured format for analytics and reporting.

ðŸ’¼ Business Importance
Customer feedback is a valuable asset for any company seeking to improve product offerings, customer experience, and brand reputation. This project empowers cross-functional teamsâ€”such as Marketing, Product, and Data Scienceâ€”with clean, timely, and accessible customer sentiment data. By implementing data governance through Unity Catalog and ensuring secure access controls, this solution supports regulatory compliance (e.g., NDPR/NIST), promotes collaboration, and accelerates data-driven decision-making across the organization.





* Use of **cloud-native data platforms (Azure Storage, Databricks)**
* **Data transformation and cleaning**, key in ETL/ELT processes
* Use of **Unity Catalog**, which aligns with **data governance, access control, and security**
* **Collaboration**, since other teams accessed the cleaned data â€” showing scalability and data sharing

### ðŸ“Š **Project Title**: Customer Review Pipeline on Azure with Unity Catalog and Databricks

**Goal**: Ingest, transform, and securely share customer review data for analytics across teams
**Stack**: Azure Storage Gen2 | Databricks | Unity Catalog | Delta Lake | PySpark

---

### ðŸ”§ **Step-by-Step Implementation**

#### **1. Data Ingestion**

* Collected raw customer reviews from a mock API (or CSV file dump).
* Ingested the data into **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (Bronze Layer)** using a secure **abfss path**.
* Directory: `abfss://<container>@<storage_account>.dfs.core.windows.net/bronze/customer_reviews/`

#### **2. Set Up Unity Catalog**

* Registered the **Azure storage** and linked it to Unity Catalog using **external locations** and **storage credentials**.
* Created a managed **schema and tables** under Unity Catalog for fine-grained access.
* Ensured **RBAC** and **data lineage tracking** were enabled for governance.

#### **3. Transformation in Databricks**

* Created a **notebook in Databricks** to process raw data using **PySpark**.
* Applied transformations:

  * Removed null entries and empty reviews
  * Extracted sentiment features (e.g., polarity, review length)
  * Standardized column formats and corrected data types
* Added **ingestion and processing timestamps**.

#### **4. Saved to Silver Layer**

* Saved the cleaned data back to **Azure Data Lake (Silver Layer)** in **Delta format**:

  * `abfss://<container>@<storage_account>.dfs.core.windows.net/silver/customer_reviews/`
* Partitioned by `review_date` for query efficiency.

#### **5. Enabled Team Access**

* Registered the transformed Delta table under **Unity Catalog** as a shared resource:

  * `catalog.analytics.customer_reviews_silver`
* Assigned access permissions using Unity Catalog policies, so **other data teams (BI, ML, etc.)** could consume the table directly.

### âœ… **Outcomes**

* Delivered a **production-ready ETL pipeline** using best practices in Azure and Databricks.
* Implemented **data security**, **governance**, and **multi-team access** via Unity Catalog.
* Optimized the pipeline for **reusability, monitoring, and scale**.
