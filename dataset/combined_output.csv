R2PALAAI6TFDFA,Good Value for those on a budget,3,neutral,Natacha Astramskas,25/03/2025,,"Pros:
* Easy installation.
* Good spray quality from both the overhead and handheld shower heads.
* Affordable price.
Cons:
* Flimsy construction.
* Difficult to tighten moving parts.
* Initial leakage at the pipe connection (required additional tape to fix).
Overall: This rain shower head is a good value for those on a budget. The spray is enjoyable, and installation is simple. However, be prepared for potential leakage and a slightly less robust build. If you need a cheap rain shower head, it gets the job done.",Uintes State
R3L6U6PSXIYTIR,Not all it’s cracked up to be.,3,neutral,Esmeralda Cabral,21/03/2025,,"The first few times using it the stream is awesome!! It comes out just like a rain shower. After though, the jets get clogged. We have a full house water filtration and purification system and it doesn’t create hard water. So, not sure where the issue lies at.",Uintes State

However, when using it in combo mode, the water pressure is non existent. This is due to the water flow actuater installed that restricts the flow to 1.8 gallons per minute.

I was very underwhelmed with the pressure from the rainfall shower head though. I don’t think it’s my water pressure in general because the handlheld shower head works great. The whole thing was fairly easy to install, took me about 20 min by myself. I got it together with no leaks on the first try. The only thing I would change is the water pressure coming from the rainfall portion.",Uintes State

R11KTT9EIRZPVP,Water holes get clogged up and stop working properly,2,negative,Sasha,11/03/2025,,"It was extremely easy to install, I did it by myself in 10 minutes and I'm not even that handy. Looks nice and easy to clean. Switching between different modes is easy to use, and the pressure is great for both the handheld and the shower head.
However, a huge issue for me is that less than a year later only 1/3 of the little holes in the rainfall shower head are working as intended. Some of them don't have water coming out at all and some of them spray the water every which way. I don't wash my hair every day and would like to keep it dry while I'm washing my face. This 360 water spraying leaves me and the whole area around the shower soaked. I clean my shower and the shower head regularly and never had such an issue with a rainfall type of installation before. I tried cleaning the holes with a toothpick and a brush but nothing seems to have any effect. So the only solution is to replace the whole thing, which I will do, but not with this brand.",Uintes State
R1EVAB7HR23PQV,Water pressure is eh,3,neutral,John,25/12/2024,,"I’m speaking only on water pressure here. I came looking for any shower head that would dump the most water. Couldn’t find anything that anyone said was above the rest, and this one was a best seller that said high pressure so I tried it. The water fall is about a 3/10 and the hand held head is about a 6/10 which is still worse than the old one I had. The multiple settings is cool, it switches between the over head and the hand held really smoothly. Quality product, but go elsewhere if you want some power!",Uintes State

When I set it to the middle setting for both the showerhead and handheld- the handheld has no pressure so when I set it to the showerhead only- the handheld leaks the entire time. I will be returning and am very sad about it because it is a nice looking showerhead.",Uintes State
RZTYM1LW14BZ8,"Nice refreshing, wand base is cheap",3,neutral,Robert,23/01/2025,,"Overall I believe the quality and power of this shower head is pretty good. I love the rainfall and the hand held wand has strong pressure in different settings form. The wall stick was very secure however I don’t like the base for the wand, it’d be nice if it had more of a securement feature. Not just placed there to fall and get knocked down. Thats the reasoning of not 5 stars.

It would be nice if the rainfall head had some different spray features as well.",Uintes State

RHY5S27D83U45,You get what you pay for! ***UPDATE,3,neutral,John,06/01/2024,,"Do yourself a favor and don’t gamble your time and money save yourself the headache and buy a brand that you know will work. I’ve gone through to of these now and they both have the same leaking issues from the same area in the coupling. I gave the benefit of the doubt on the first one and went ahead with the replacement option finally get some time to install it and they’re both leaking from the exact same “loose” area that allows the arm to pivot and from an engineering standpoint that is the worst ideas when it comes to fluids. Needless to say instead of the two nozzle option I get a complimentary 3 jet that spews like a geyser from an area that should be water tight. With that being said if I took some precious time out of my meager existence I could probably fix it but I’m not purely because I bought this with the intention of having a plug and play shower head and go about my life. Now please excuse me while I go and reattach my old shower head that doesn’t leak because it’s not an entire da Vinci mechanism just to hose myself off…

Edit & UPDATE***: Customer service rep contacted shortly after I left my review. They where extremely concerned with my personal qualm aswell the quality of the product they where distributing. In my personal humble opinion customer CS reaching out to me in a very professional and timely manner means more to me than a faulty piece of equipment. They went above and beyond fixing the the situation and I’m very grateful for their sincerity. With that I changed my original rating from a 1 star to a 3 star regarding their professional and timely customer satisfaction concern for their product quality.",Uintes State

After posting my review I was contacted by the seller and offered apologies and a full refund. It is refreshing to know there are still good sellers on-line. Although this item did not meet my expectations, I certainly recommend the seller.

ORIGINAL:
Looks nice, but not the quality I expected.
Very low water pressure and joints are flimsy.",Uintes State
R3U8GNLNFGS4TM,"Cool look. Not high pressure, lower temperature water.",3,neutral,Crispy Dayz,12/05/2024,,"I was very excited about this rain shower head with an extension arm. It was very easy to install, looks sleek, and it did not leak. Unfortunately, however, the pressure from the rain shower is barely there, such that using both the arm extension and rainfall at the same time is not realistic. That is without even using the pressure regulator that comes included if you need it. The arm extension has more pressure although not an impressive amount as my older shower head. The function options are also quite limited. Something odd in my experience with this shower is that I had to set the water to a much hotter setting for it to feel like the temperature that I normally use as compared to my previous shower head. This effect is even more pronounced with the arm extension, probably because of the long hose that gives the water a chance to cool down as it flows.

My bathroom is far from the water heater, and although I have never had an issue with other shower heads, this one seems to struggle with temperature regulation and driving water pressure. I think these experiences probably depend on the layout of your house, how much pressure you get, and how far you are from your water heater. It just did not work out for me.",Uintes State
R1S3SOY4Y3JEMN,Lacks water pressure,3,neutral,DSK3,29/01/2025,,I like it and it seems to be made well but it really lacks water pressure. We have great water pressure at our house but this makes it seems like we don't. I'll probably end up replacing just the shower head part with something else.,Uintes State

R1RAO9BD6KXVYT,Mixed feelings,3,neutral,Mari,06/12/2024,,The rain head isnt high flow what so ever but its nice enough for the price. The water flow won't get any soap out of your hair but that's what the hand holds for. The hand holds flow is really good and actually gets rid of all the conditoner and soap but it has a horrendous bracket that's annoying to deal with. Wish they made it so that it would actually stay in place but this is what you get for this price range. Really like being able to pause the water on handheld mode so I'll keep it but will be looking for a better bracket to keep it in place.,Uintes State
R22Q1LN48TRFGD,Works good. It smells,3,neutral,Buyer,17/01/2025,,"Easy to install and works great! However, 5 months later, the water coming from the handheld piece still strongly smells of chemicals for about 10 seconds every time it’s used",Uintes State

So, the hand sprayer... The mount is baffling and bad. It basically works, but the sprayer doesn't really fit. Trying to force it down to stay put isn't a good experience. Also, the silver backing looks cheap and mine is sliding down over the clear adhesive on the back.,,,,,Uintes State

The rainfall head does not have enough pressure and I'm left feeling cold in the shower.

What I got was a drizzle. There’s hardly any water pressure in the rain water shower head which is a big bummer. The hand held option has more water pressure and is a better option, but doesn’t offer that spa like experience. I felt like I was being beat to death by water.

I recently fell and fractured some bones, so I cannot take it off to research what is wrong. I would not buy this again, but the price is low. If it lasts 6-12 months I'll figure I got my money's worth. I do like that you can have both heads spraying, not strong, or one spray which is obviously stronger.

Only down fall is the adhesive on the handheld shower wall mount is unreliable. Cleaned the shower wall, dried it with a fresh towel and the mount fell off after 2 showers within 12 hours. The weight bent the handheld wall mount as it fell and now between the lack of adhesive and bent thin material, it can no longer adhere to our shower wall let alone hold the handheld shower head. I’m so bummed because I love this shower head! Will hope I can find a replacement handheld mount at Home Depot. This adhesive reminds of a slightly stickier version of a standard peel and stick sticker. The shower head itself is a dream & well worth the cost! The handheld mount in my opinion, from this experience, would benefit from a little upgrade. Otherwise I enjoy the luxury feeling this shower head provides!",Uintes State

RTQCAKJGJ04W3,Was great at first....,2,negative,Shelby Taylor,09/12/2024,,"Purchased Aug 2024.

Easy to install. No problems there.

Ran great for a while, was a great upgrade from the previous setup.

Then, a few weeks back, it started to leak from the main shower head while the faucet runs to fill the tub.

I often switch it to the handheld just to avoid cold water dropping on my children when they sit in the tub as it fills. (It drips for about 5-10 minutes after the faucet is turned off.)

So.... for $50... I could have absolutely found a better option.

Very bummed because I really liked it.",Uintes State

RXZ8VWQ1YHKTV,Handheld wand falls off,2,negative,Laura,18/08/2024,,"This is one of the worst shower head combos I have ever bought.

First the photos are deceptive. I thought the main shower head would be bigger. It is much skinnier than I wanted.

The handheld wand is the worst part. The plastic piece that is supposed to hold the wand is completely wrong it doesn’t hold it up well. It’s like it is not made for this set.

I tried reaching out to the seller about this but the Amazon AI chat assistant won’t let me. It only gave me the option to return it, but the return window has passed.

As a result of the poor attachment piece the shower wand keeps falling off the wall at the slightest touch and is scuffing up my shower pan pretty badly.

I do not recommend.",Uintes State

However, within just a couple hours of wearing them, it seem like the straps had actually completely stretched out, and the shoes were basically almost falling off my feet. That is ridiculous and absolutely should not be happening. Obviously I got what I paid for and will spend the extra money for higher quality shoes next time.

This one was a difficult item because the range of prices between the best and the less highly rated is astounding. Particularly when you see how they all look. They practically look the same. I would say there is no way on earth it makes sense to pay five times the cost of these to buy scissors that in photos can barely be distinguished from these.

Among scissors that price wise are closer to earth these looked good to me so with some hesitation I forwent going for the stratosphere and bought these. It turns out I'm more puzzled than ever because these scissors for kitchen duty are terrific! Precision fit, sharp, comfortable - nothing else you could ask for.

It is xmas time. A lot of people have present giving games where people take turns using a lottery system to blindly pick a present from a stack of presents everyone contributes to.

R2LOAV3DKVI70V,The benchmark in general purpose kitchen shears,5,positive,"Live Simple, Live Well",25/10/2024,,"We’ve been using these for years.

The bottom line. Kitchen Aid All Purpose shears are close to perfect, very favorably-priced, and in our experience, do everything you’d want for general food preparation so there is simply no need to ever spend more for other brands.

The shears which do not come apart are better for tasks where you need to fully open them up—like cutting salad in a big bowl—and where the blades may tend to come apart.

We throw them in the dishwasher, have never needed to disassemble them to get them clean, and have not yet experienced any related food poisoning 😊.

We use them for everything food-related in the kitchen except for the heaviest cutting, where we use a set of heavy duty kitchen shears.

All in all, these things are maintenance-free, always work well and are inexpensive. Hard to beat that combination.",Uintes State

The second order a year later had a collar that was about 2/3rds the size as the original and the material was thinner, but it still fit nice around the neck and held up well so I got used to it. I am still actually wearing some of these two years later.

For this most recent purchase, all five shirts had collars that were thin and loose, with almost no tension. They stick straight up instead of snug around the neck, and it is so loose that it feels like I'm wearing a polo with an open neck in the front. It's almost like someone grabbed the collar and intentionally stretched it out, but it's all five shirts so I assume it's by design.

The real soft ones never have said that & honestly I can’t find them on Amazon period anymore unless it’s made by a brand name like adidas or Nike. Those are a bit pricey for work tops, & I realize these aren’t, but I wish they didn’t try to pull it off as being ultra soft when no person could honestly call this soft unless they’re Tarzan dressed in straw.

Bad fit, rough fabric, not worth cheap price",2,negative,Amazon Customer,08/04/2021,,"I do not understand all the high ratings for these shirts. These fit oddly and poorly. The neck is loose, the shoulder seams are spaced way too far apart (as if made for the shoulders of someone 4 sizes larger than XL--and I do have broad shoulders), the armpits have too much fabric & are baggy, the arm holes are too big, the part over the torso and waist is not generously cut. The main part of this shirt (the part over your abdomen and waist) is seamless--no side seams. That might explain the odd cut. I have many older Gildan t-shirts that fit more normally, and made of soft cotton. I previously tried the slightly lighter-weight current version, and it was incredibly thin, but also fit terribly. This model has heavier fabric, but the fit is unusable and the fabric is rough and not soft. I compared this t-shirt to six older t-shirts that I already own--all acquired from different places and made by various companies, including Gildan. This one is far worse than my others, and the lousy fit is my biggest reason for sending them back.

R25HFV82ITRME0,Uncomfortable shirts. Feel like the sleeves are on backward,2,negative,Al S,27/12/2018,,"Right off: If I had tried them on before laundering, I would have returned these shirts.

They are so uncomfortable. I got an XL because I don't like tight shirts. These have enough room in the body, but if your body doesn't completely fill out the shirt (which would make it fairly snug), it does not hang right, so it feels like the sleeves are on backward. Like this: If I have my arms straight down, it's fine; and if I move my arm backward, it's fine; but if I raise my arm forward, it immediately pulls taut on the sleeve because I don't have a huge chest pushing the front of the shirt way out.

I've been wearing XLs for a while and I've only experienced this kind of cut once, with a Hanes T-shirt. I guess if I was bigger it would make things line up properly, but then the shirt would also feel too small. I have other shirts from this brand but this cut is much different.

They run a little on the short side, which is another reason I went with XL.

That said: The material is really good - heavy and you can tell it will last. If you wear them more fitted, they'll probably be OK for you.",Uintes State

I bought a large, as a medium-framed guy carrying a few extra pounds. I go between med and large depending on season, etc. The large fit as I would expect from a large-sized shirt. Length and cut/shoulder seams were pretty good

The fabric is AWFUL. Very coarse threaded--some might call it 'scratchy' though it does not make you itch. I almost returned immediately but put them through the washer w/ fabric softener, in hopes things might loosen up a bit after a wash. They didn't. Pretty awful shirts in terms of fabric quality, but will suffice as sacrificial work tees or rags for doing automotive work. For the price I paid, fair I suppose.

Second, the ends curl up something terrible. I have never had t shirts that curl like them. I just dont think there is enough fabric at the ends to make them not curl.

Update: after 6 months, I am disappointed in these. They have done nothing but curl on the sleeves and bottoms. It is irritating. I am going to scrap these and go with some better quality tees

Other then the t shirt curl, these are not bad. I think they may run a bit small, or maybe they just shrank a little",Uintes State

My first set was a pair of Ghost several years ago that lasted me a few years. I then purchased Launch GTS about 2 years ago.

The first pair I ordered, were WAY too small and narrow. I returned and replaced them with 9.5W, and they still fit uncomfortably. I wondered if this was potentially an Amazon issue, so I took a look at recent reviews of the Ghost and even other models on the Brooks website, and there were so many recent reviews all pointing out that new models of shoes are much smaller, narrower, and fit differently in the arch.

Not only do you have to size up with these, but you have to go up in the width as well because they are much narrower than the Ghost 15. Not sure what the hell they did to the cushion either, but the days I wore the Ghost 16s, my knees kept snapping whenever i squatted down (felt like knife digging into knee). The days I wore the Ghost 15s, I've had no issues with my knees. Additionally, the toe box is very different with the 16s; there's some hard material in there that when touched, it'll leave a dent that will be felt by the toes and does not pop back out unless you take the shoes off and manually pop it back out with your fingers.",Uintes State

I only use them for walking. I have been wearing the same style of Brooks Ghost shoe for 6 years and decided to get the updated ones for the wider toe box. I plan to go to Italy this year and thought the lighter weight would be an added bonus to pack.

In less than a week, these were showing wear. The sole was crushing down. The my previous shoe's soles, for lack of a better description, made with a dense rubber.

R33L19JNHHH8ST,"Had to re-order due to defect, replacement pair is also defective.",1,negative,LJ,,24/01/2025,"Updated 2/19/2025: I ordered these a 3rd time because my regular size 8 was too large, so I ordered a 7.5. The inconsistency in sizing of Brooks shoes in the same exact style and color from shoe to shoe is extremely frustrating. I really like these shoes, so I kept trying. The 7.5 is slightly short, so I was going to try ordering another pair, but at this point I’m giving up and will look for another style. Both pairs of size 8 ordered previously were too large, plus the logo on the outside was sewn on incorrectly on both pairs. I do not recommend these!

Updated review 1/27/2025: I re-ordered these, and the new ones are also sewn incorrectly. This time the logo rubs through the fabric on both shoes, so this is a defective design and/or shoe fabric. The arch support is poor, but the insoles are removable. It’s nice that Brooks changed to using athletic laces that stay tied and aren’t 10 inches too long. The toe-box of the Regular width is extremely wide, think clown shoes, with so much room that my foot slides around in the front. I love the color, and wanted so badly to get a pair that wasn’t sewn incorrectly, but that didn’t happen. Returning this second pair.

I like Brooks sneakers, as they keep me from having knee pain when I wear them, but it’s been very difficult to buy them as the sizing is often inaccurate, the fit is inconsistent, and they don’t offer the promised arch support, so I always end up paying extra to buy inserts. I bought these in Coconut Zephyr White, which is a pretty pink and cream color. It would be nice if the listed colors actually gave some idea of what the color actually is, but it’s always a surprise. I was happy to finally get a size 8 (my usual size) that actually fit, although the Regular width is SUPER wide at the front. They look like clown shoes, but I like the color. Sadly, the logo is sewn on wrong on the left shoe, causing it to rub on the side of my foot. I had to return them. I’m ordering another pair and will update this review accordingly.",Uintes State

They squeeze & cause terrible pain including the arch & heel. I almost couldn’t get my foot in the shoe at all. The opening of the shoe is so stiff & small. I can’t wear these.

Have been buying crocs for many years. New to buying supposed authentic apparel from off Amazon or app websites. Every time I do weird situations arise, as like this. I bought 3 pairs of crocs from this website at the same time, that says Amazon selling crocs shoes with the crocs store website within the description. One of the pairs was inaccurate size and description. And as for these particular ones I bought 2 of the same size and color. It says size 9w and 7m. Unfortunately one fits extremely smaller than the other and one of them came in a crocs bag with crocs logo and product description. The other identical one came in a tear away bag with no product description. 3 pairs of crocs from this same website advertising crocs store and two out of three which have to be returned and are of the same exact shoes, color, and size that fits completely different (much smaller), than the identically purchased shoes bought at the same exact time.

As for the 3rd pair, I should’ve caught that it said men’s size 2. There is no such size as a men size shoe. Amazon/crocs are selling little kids shoes for adult prices in adult section. It was advertised as size 4w/2m adult unisex. Returning immediately. There is no such thing as a men’s size 2. I should’ve caught that.
It’s not an adult shoe. They are selling children sizes and charging adult prices. This is a kids croc.

R1GXMNW9UGS3RK,4 (or 5) major differences between these & all others I've bought of same style & size,1,negative,HalfFullJulie,,08/02/2024,"Background: I've been buying Crocs Classic Clog, size Women's 9, for over a decade.

These look like Crocs at first glance, but there are at least 4 differences.
1. These are about one size smaller than all other Crocs of this same size & style.
2. There is an ugly bulging at the big toe, which is caused by #3 below.
3. The toe of the shoe curls significantly upward. I don't want my toes bent backward.
4. They say made in Vietnam. I called the Crocs company & was told that all their shoes are made in China.

This led me to add a #5 to this list.

5. Since all Crocs are made in China & these were made in Vietnam, does that also mean they lack the silver that is in Croc shoes? Silver kills the bacteria that causes odor, & I have noticed that any odor in them is gone by the next day. The silver is the reason I only buy Croc clogs.

The bottoms were very smooth and comfortable, but for some reason one of the straps tore and came off so I ordered the pair I'm now wearing from Amazon and they are extremely uncomfortable with nibs so long on the insoles that they hurt and make my feet ache. Being a diabetic I can't risk the crocs causing problem. I wondered about the crocs so I took them to an actual croc store in Myrtle Beach and the sales lady assured me they were authentic saying that it depends on what country the crocs are made in as to how the nibs are on the insoles. She suggested sanding off the nibs with sandpaper saying that is what her Dad did, The Croc employee was so nice, helpful, and sweet especially when I fell in the store. She only had one problem: her name wasn't Amazon. I wish I had sent the shoes back but for a swap-out but I didn't. I hoped the nibs would wear down. They haven't. In researching this particular order, I discovered the straps on the new crocs are removable, so I am going to look at removing them and placing them on my original pair of crocs. Croc Corporate is trying to help me and they have been extremely nice just like the Amazon employees with whom I have dealt. I guess I am just a balding, fat, Southern old coot who is too set in his ways about what he likes or doesn't. I look at my wife of 35 years and then at Amazon.

I need to get Crocs so bad and hat going to the mall but these are sized completely wrong. These also didn’t show the W and M size just M11 but it was not nearly large enough to be a Men’s 11. This has to be a manufacturers defect. Labeled correctly but size wrong or maybe it should have been labeled W11. Either way frustrating…I want to order several pairs in different sizes but the headache of having to keep returning is not appealing. Manufacturer needs to check their shoe sizes as they are way off. I see others have experienced the same thing. My previous ordered from a year ago or so were great.

Personal taste aside, this past Summer I decided I would buy a pair to use for working outside. I am an avid gardener, and during growing season, I am always coming in and out of the yard, and I hate having to take my shoes on and off every single time so I don't track dirt into the house. When I saw these on sale, I figured they would be perfect for working in the garden.
After a couple of weeks of regular wear, I started to notice plantar fasciitis acting up. I wasn't sure what the cause was as I always wear shoes, even in the house. As soon as I stopped wearing the Crocs, the pain went away. A week or so went by and I started wearing them again. By the end of the day, the pain was back. Since I've stopped wearing them altogether, the pain is gone and has not returned.

As others warned, these new crocs are nothing like the crocs of yore. They look like a shriveled version of the old crocs--narrower, shorter, and the toe box points upwards at the end. The old crocs were so loose that if you were seated you could forget they were on your feet--not so with these. They press against the top of my arch and the strap cuts into the back of my ankle. The toe box is still big enough, but the upwards angle causes my big toe joint to ache when I walk. The interior nubs are so pointy that it feels like some kind of neuropathy. Sort of like a soft bed of nails. Even when worn with ever-so-attractive socks. The material doesn't feel a cushy as the crocs that have several years wear on them. This is the 2nd pair I have tried and will now return. Made in Vietnam, for what that's worth. I assume that ordering a size up will only make them too large, and won't mitigate the other problems. Crocs, why did you have to ruin such a fine product?! Instead of making 50 million new colors, couldn't you just give us one option for an original croc?

Crocs' website says to order your correct size and so that's what I did and my feet are absolutely swimming in these things. They feel 3 sizes too big. Sizing down doesn't do much of anything to correct the fit because the width is still absurd and they feel like they are going to fall off my feet when I try to walk. Now I see that Amazon's website suggests sizing down for all of Crocs' standard clogs. Come on, I'm not going to play these silly games with shoe size.

Crocs are nice own other pairs, great for around the house if you haver pain in feet. Good shower shoe, and good idea to shower with them because they make your feet sweat bad which creates a smell that can then transfer to your shoes. Then you need to throw your shoes in washing machine and it becomes a lot of hassle so just make sure to check them.

R5YDHYYARKZU0,Manufacturing Country matters,1,negative,Amazon Customer,,24/01/2023,"So after my original order got lost (shipped to a whole diff zip code) I was sent a replacement. This order said it was made in Mexico (my last pair was from Indonesia). The quality was not the same as others I have owned and the size is not the same. This one from Mexico though I bought my usual size was bigger somehow.

All this difference in quality caused a lot of unease for me. Had me checking if the product was genuine and lifespan of the material and what not. Turns out Crocs stopped manufacturing in Mexico in August 2018 which led me to research the Lifespan of the product. It says it should last up to 10 years if not used much. So guess I should have no issues with flaking and rotting

All am saying is quality control matters. The inconsistencies with the material and size caused a lot of unnecessary discomfort for me.

These are Crocs and there's really nothing new to write about them — function over form, by a long shot, and they do seem to wear decently.

But the last three pair I've ordered from Amazon have been WAY off in size, obviously incorrectly marked.

As a size 10, I ordered three pair of Crocs 10M/12F at three different times. I received all three pair (at separate times) **marked** 10M/12F, but they were INCORRECTLY marked. They were at least one size too large, closer to 1.5 sizes too large.

Be prepared to return them if they don't fit properly, and note them **DEFECTIVE** as they are incorrectly marked.

Out of a total of four pair I ordered, only one was true to fit. Not a good record. I want to order one more pair, but I'm unsure as to whether to try again for my size or a size smaller. It may have been a bad lot and maybe now they're back on track.

PROTIP: Check out other buyers on Amazon because some sellers on Amazon list crocs with only a one size difference in the men and women. For example (8 women’s / 9 mens), it seems odd at first because that’s not how croc manufactures them but it IS more accurate, especially for this seller!!

I contacted Amazon and CROCS about this and they both were extremely unhelpful in this situation. I was told there is nothing they can do because I was over the return day policy. UNACCEPTABLE!!!
I held onto these for a Christmas gift and was totally embarrassed when my daughter opened them and they were 2 completely different sizes of shoes and she is now unable to wear them. We are now stuck with shoes that she can't wear and I am out of money from this purchase. I don't understand how there is nothing they can do about this considering it wasn't my fault!

I'll just exchange them for a size up. Well after going through the quick exchange thing on Amazon I waited for my new ones. They arrived on time, but to my dismay they were too small again. Now I thought this was weird because its a FULL size up and the original ones I ordered were only JUST too small. So I compared them to the originals and sure enough, they were the exact same size despite being labeled a size larger. They were each manufactured in different countries and the 2nd pair had some weird stuff going on with how they were packaged. But idc about the packaging.

I Ordered a new pair in May of 2022. When they arrive they felt a bit tight to put the strap on my foot, but chalked it up to the fact they needed to be broken in as the others I had for 20 years probably stretched out a bit. Anyway was putting them on in May of 2023 and the strap broke on one of them. What recourse do I have to get a new pair and not pay full price for them , these are just a year old, there should be some kind of guarantee that they will not break in one year??

I ordered the black ones in a women’s 7. The left shoe fits great, the right shoe is about a size too big all over — like it’s it’s longer AND wider.
Nope, it’s not that my feet are different sizes either — the shoes are visibly different in size, see pics.
These ones say made in China, but in fairness, so does an older pair that I have— those ones are in fact genuine, so the place of manufacturing may not have anything to do with the authenticity as others have suggested.
I think the issue is that Crocs quality control isn’t great. I bought a pair of the heeled wedge sandals a few years back and the straps are snug on one foot not another. I thought it was my foot so I kept them, then I bought another pair of the exact style in a different color and they were perfectly fine!

All three pairs are labeled the same size. 1) This pair is much wider than they used to be, much wider than my other two pairs. 2) This pair is much shorter in length than the other two. 3) The strap is much looser with a wide gap between the shoe and the strap when the strap is in the up position.
These are my go to shoes, but I can't wear this new pair because they are so much wider. (My feet are different widths. One is regular width and the other is large width. These are too wide on my large width foot.) Having the strap stick up much higher than the shoe looks really off. Looks like it has the wrong strap on. Quality has gone downhill and it appears there is no size control now. My other two pairs are the same size, while these are wider, shorter and wonky. So disappointed.

I thought maybe my 9 year old granddaughter could wear them. I took them over to her and they did fit but she didn’t like the color.

He’s always found them comfortable and we have gone through many pairs over the years. Now we just bought a new pair and they fit great with ONE BIG EXCEPTION.

When my son pointed this out and how uncomfortable it would be I thought he was kidding. Sure enough I ran my fingers over it and yeah it would be very uncomfortable. Luckily I had his previous pair and was able to remove the heel strap, without any printing, and replace it on the new pair. Most people may not have this option so I would caution against buying these as I know it would rub against the skin and be very uncomfortable. Bad decision from the manufacturer!

R10EEQE84MZUU,Not comfortable like the original Crocs,2,negative,Queen,,11/03/2025,"I own several pairs of Crocs because I need to walk on soft surfaces but I also need some arch support. The old Crocs were absolute perfect for this. I could wear them for many hours and felt like I walking on clouds!
I just received two new pairs but, I am going to return them because, unfortunately, the inside of these Crocs are not as comfortable as the original ones: the bottom is not as soft, the support arch is not as strong, and those little bumps on top of the soles are sharp to the point of being painful. I tried to wear them with socks but I still would not be able to wear them for long hours at home or outside.
It seems that, in very recent years, some genius at Crocs has decided it was a good idea to make them more uncomfortable. Crocs have been very popular for many years not because of their looks but because of the high level of comfort they provided. I understand they felt the need to improved the look by coming up with more designs, colors, glitters, etc. but, why did they diminished the comfort? Did they think we wouldn’t notice it?
Please bring back the old softness of the sole, the supporting arch, and take the sharpness of those tiny bumps away!
At this point, I would not recommend this product to anyone. Why pay more money to have authentic, but uncomfortable, Crocs when you can buy an imitation for less money?",Uintes State
RPPRCAN5LVM9B,Overpriced unless on sale I guess I am a boomer,2,negative,Daviddabulls,,24/03/2025,"My kids are completely sold on the comfort of their Crocs, and for wearing around the house, they seem perfectly adequate. The ease with which they can be slipped on and off is convenient for indoor use. However, when it comes to venturing out, I strongly feel these are not appropriate footwear for public settings, with the exception of the pool or beach where practicality takes precedence. While they are easy to clean and durable enough for casual wear, their very distinct and, in my opinion, unattractive style makes them unsuitable for general public outings. Ultimately, their utility feels limited to a very specific set of circumstances, making them a less versatile footwear option overall. I guess I'm getting old, but for what are essentially foam shoes, I also feel they are overpriced unless you can snag them on sale.",Uintes State

Third & final time I ordered size 9 womens. Not sure what's up with Crocs, but the foot bed fits when sitting. Take a step and my toes move forward & jam against toe box. This has happened with size 8, size 9 in Crocs as well as Nautica brand. I tried wearing socks to keep my foot in place & although it helped a tad, it was NOT the solution. I had worn them out for a day to give them a true test. Unfortunately they failed the test & I cannot return them. Prior to buying on Amazon I looked for local shoe stores that sell them so I could try them on in person. For such a popular shoe I was surprised to see them lacking in shoe stores! Money wasted, lesson learned. When I get sick of seeing their ugliness in my closet which should be any minute now, I will donate them to Salvation Army or Goodwill as they are clearly in brand new condition.

Of course, Crocs are always loose and most peoples' feet look like they are swimming in them, but that pair and a previous pair stayed on because of the way the shoe was shaped, and were really comfortable. I think the too-long length and wide footbed were actually helpful in keeping the shoe on. Now, the Crocs are shorter in length and narrower, and yet don't stay on. I believe it has to do with the length. It looks right on my foot, but my foot falls out. I wish that Crocs would keep the styles or shapes that they used to have.",Uintes State

I ordered another pair first, but they were way too wide and because they were a different style, I assumed that style just ran wider. So, ordered another pair in the same style as my old Crocs, and found them to be really wide, also. My feet just kind of swim in them. You can see the difference in width, even though the sizes and styles are the same. Too bad they didn't just offer a wide version instead of making them all wide - they are not nearly as comfortable to wear now.",Uintes State
R27SH934YMFUVT,No half sizes. Tight Inner Curve for Top Edge Can Create a Wound.,2,negative,J. A. Shea,,23/07/2023,"Size 12 for Crocs Classic Crush Sandal was too large. My foot often slid forward. When the left front strap broke, it was beyond 90 days to return them to Crocs, 13601 Via Varra, Broomfield, CO 80020. So, from Amazon, I ordered these Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Clogs in size 11. Size 11 is too small. When the size is too small, the heel strap pulls the top edge of the sandal up and onto the skin of the foot. After wearing them two times, the sandal’s posterior edge (closest to the ankle) on the medial side (above the arch) wore my skin off in a line on both feet. I had to tape cotton on my feet over the painful wounds while wearing Beslip Women’s/Men’s Garden Clogs, size 11.5, that I bought at Amazon. In addition to the half size, Beslip Women’s/Men’s Garden Clogs have a much more accommodating curve for the top edge of the sandal. Conclusion, Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Clogs are okay if you don’t need a half size. Otherwise, feet either slide around in them or they are too tight and create a wound.",Uintes State

It came slightly dirty on the bottom which I didnt care because they're crocs and I can wash them but I couldn't figure out why the 9s were still so freaking big so I ordered a size 8 to try which are a little tight. I finally looked at the bottom of the 'size 9s' and they had sent me another size 10. I went to check the black plastic hang tag, that said mens 7/ womens size 8! Wtf! The women's 8 that I received was marked on the hang tag as a mens 5/ womens 6 but om the bottom says womens 8.

That means the front top half of this Navy shoe is too short. I made an in-store purchase the previous week. A black pair with the same size of Unisex 10/8 was also a little too short. Returned those too.

R2IXTZTNHKIH3W,just not right for my body,2,negative,Colin Higgins,,30/10/2023,"At first I loved these shoes. I got them in February. They were my first pair of Crocs. They were so convenient, comfortable, easy to keep clean, and fun. Around the end of March, I noticed, my left hip started hurting, and then my left knee too, a bit. In July, I wondered if maybe it was the new shoes I was wearing every day, and decided to try not wearing them anymore. It is October now and my knee seems ok, and the hip has improved a lot. This probably would have happened with any pair of plastic shoes I had chosen. Before these Crocs, and after, I have been very happy with my New Balance athletic shoes.
I would say that there was nothing wrong with these at all, but I can't recommend them based on my own personal experience, because wearing them was bad for my body.",Uintes State

More importantly, they are not made properly either. I have been lucky to have nearly symmetrical feet- I rarely find a pair of shoes that fits one foot but not the other. The Croc's right shoe fits properly, the left pinches/rubs my big toe. I took them off and looked carefully and the left one is curved inward at the toebox. Either the mold was defective, or the operator pulled them off at an angle before they were fully cured.

R20VSFFPLXAKM0,Cute shoes. But too small or too large if you're a true half size!,2,negative,Abbott,,07/10/2016,"I bought a size 9 (women) since I wear a 9 in a sandal. I wear a 9.5 in a closed toe shoe. But there was a recommendation in this description that half sizes should order down. So I thought a size 9 would be just right for me. Alas, they are too short. The end of my toes touches the front of the shoe even without a sock. So I immediately had to put them back in the box and return them. According to my experience, one would order a size up, not a size down. A 9 is too short for a 9.5 foot. Still, they are very nice and attractive shoes, so I'm ordering a size 10. I'm giving 5 stars because there was nothing wrong with the shoes, just bought the wrong size and don't think the description should have suggested ordering a size down.

Update: I have to change my rating from a 5 star to a 2 star for the simple reason that they will not work for someone like me with exactly 1/2 size off. After the above-described experience (ordering a size 9 women for my 9.5 foot), I sent them back and ordered a size 10 women. They are enormous. I can't possibly wear them even with a very thick sock. They fit me like boats. I really wanted to like these, and except for their being a smidgeon too small in size 9, I really would have liked them. I guess I have to give up on Crocs. I would guess there are a lot of people like me in between sizes who can't make them work. Much of the problem might be that when the size gets larger, both the length and the width increase. I didn't need them any wider at all, just a tiny bit longer. Too bad.",Uintes State

R4WME18FXKYPZ,Not like my old Crocs,2,negative,Tripping Wisteria,,16/04/2015,"I bought my first pair of Crocs almost ten years ago, back when they were made in Colorado. They were the most comfortable shoe for hanging around the house or cooking in the kitchen for long periods of time. My house has tile or hardwood so there isn't a lot of give there. Those Crocs were made out of a softer, squishier rubber that had a lot of give to it. These Crocs are made of a firmer material that seems like it has some plastic in it. They aren't very cushioned. They are also a lot smaller. They fit but just barely. Don't know if that's because I got a pair from Mexico instead of China (and how weird is it to be hoping you get one of the ones from China but all the reviews agree they fit better than the ones from Mexico.) Also these have anti-fatigue nubs inside. They are arranged in ridges, higher in some parts than others. You can see it's meant to be higher above the ball of your foot, under your toes but the weird sizing keeps my foot from fitting perfectly in that area so mostly I'm just walking on uneven nubs. I don't know if they work for anti-fatigue because they hurt my feet and I can only wear these shoes for about an hour at a time. I suppose it will be like when I was a kid in the summer and at first it hurt to go barefoot outside but after a while your feet toughen up and it stops hurting. Not thrilled though to have paid money for shoes that my feet have to toughen up for. They are also a lot hotter to wear than my old Crocs. Not sure if it's because of the smaller size or the new material. Overall, I'm very unhappy with these shoes. Looks like I'll have to find a replacement for my old Crocs elsewhere.",Uintes State

The bottom of the shoe is incredibly supportive, but it’s very hard and after a while, it becomes uncomfortable and the same back lip issue persists.

I only use them for walking. I have been wearing the same style of Brooks Ghost shoe for 6 years and decided to get the updated ones for the wider toe box. I plan to go to Italy this year and thought the lighter weight would be an added bonus to pack.

In less than a week, these were showing wear. The sole was crushing down. The my previous shoe's soles, for lack of a better description, made with a dense rubber.

R29FHO0T0BPTKG,These are the most uncomfortable pair of underwear I have ever worn,1,negative,Chris S.,,26/02/2024,"Title: Disappointing Experience with Hanes Underwear

Rating: ★★☆☆☆

I recently purchased a pack of Hanes underwear with high hopes, given the brand's reputation for comfort and quality. Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory, leaving me with no choice but to share my disappointment.

The most glaring issue was the poor fit of the underwear. Despite selecting the correct size based on the sizing chart, I found the underwear to be uncomfortably tight and restrictive. The waistband dug into my skin, causing discomfort throughout the day. It was surprising to encounter such a basic fit problem from a brand like Hanes, known for its commitment to providing comfortable undergarments.

The restrictive nature of the underwear also made it challenging to move freely. Whether sitting for an extended period or engaging in physical activities, the underwear failed to provide the flexibility and ease of movement that one would expect. This lack of comfort was a constant reminder of the poor fit, making it difficult to go about daily activities without feeling constantly bothered.

Another notable issue was the overall quality of the material. The fabric used in these particular Hanes underwear felt cheap and lacked the softness that the brand is typically associated with. After just a few washes, I noticed signs of wear and tear, further adding to my dissatisfaction.

In summary, my experience with Hanes underwear was disappointing, primarily due to the poor fit, restrictive design, and subpar quality of the material. For a brand that has built its reputation on comfort, this particular product fell short of expectations. I would caution others to carefully consider their options before choosing Hanes for their underwear needs, as my experience suggests that not all products from this brand live up to its well-established reputation.",Uintes State

R2MUML2E2EDPER,Inconsistent quality,1,negative,Shawn,,21/12/2021,"Let me start out by saying that there are three different types in this one pack. The first being that the grey pair has a different material makeup. I noticed this in the description and is not a big deal. Now let's get to the other two...

First the red, blue, and green: these three pairs have weird stitching along the bottom of the leg holes. Due to the stitch type, they do not stretch. I work in the textile manufacturing field with sewing operations and this is not something that I would expect on this type of clothing. I am an average size person (6 foot tall, 200 pounds) and these boxers are uncomfortably tight on the thighs. So tight that I actually debated leaving work on lunch break to go home and change. Maybe these are a good fit for chicken little or someone without legs? Also they are a little tight in other areas with very little stretch it you catch my drift.

The black and grey pairs have a normal stitch along the legs which allow them to stretch and fit. A better fit in the thighs, but still tight in other areas.

I love my older style Hanes comfort cool"" but would not recommend these ""comfort flex"" to anyone except chicken little or someone with a chicken little body build.""",Uintes State

But no front support, just loose fitting. There is perfect feeling of fit and assurance, on the legs. But on the front, where it matters, there is the absence of feeling, the sensation of discomfort because there’s no credible specific support. Colors or style, or contrast stitching don't matter. It's what counts. The photos showing the presumption of a front, contoured support, do not 'support' the actual garment itself. There isn't any of the picture contour of the front that exists when wearing this undergarment. Candidly, it should be the form of a cup, that actually acts like like a supportive sewn in area. Akin, politely said, to a brassiere, that should have the support feature yet it's only a loose fitting fabric that offers no assurances.

The description says G2000 but the shirts feel thinner than the ones I purchased in Aug of 2023. I don't know if they changed something in the production or these are mislabeled but they are definitely not the G2000 style.

These shirts so far fit great. We'll see how long they last before they start pilling. If you wear a size larger than 3x, forget having any color options except black or white. Complete joke. It shows the color dots then has +87 for different colors. As soon as you choose 4-5xl the options change to black and white. Probably won't be purchasing anymore of these until they offer some more options!!

Update: Oct. '23. Have been looking for an actual yellow, not neon, gold or these other non yellow shirts. Thought I found it. It was labeled as the G2000 Ultra. It most definitely is Not. It's a different number/style. I believe it says heavyweight but it's like those paper gowns at the Dr office. Not worth wasting g my time to return it.

These gray shirts looked and fit great even after machine washing. I decided to buy a bunch of white G2000 'T' shirts to tie-dye. The Gildan White G2000 aren't made like the Gray G2000 'T' shirts. The gray were a heavier grade cotton, with better stitching et cetera. So, I thought that I'd get some of the same type in White. I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the shirts that I received, not only were they of cheaper quality cotton, synthetic thread was used to stitch to shirt which shows up like a spot light (when tie-dyed)because (of course) synthetic thread will not take up Procion MX dye. If the shirt description states 100% cotton the shirt should be 100% cotton, otherwise the description should state that the shirt stitching is synthetic and not 100% cotton. There should be no difference in quality of materials between the 2 colors of shirts but there was. The difference in a tie-dye between a quality white shirt and the Gilda G2000 is night and day. I feel 'sullied and unclean' for having used the White G2000 'T' shirts. One can be sure that I will no longer use the Gildan product even to clean the floor.

These shirts were a stark contrast from the Everlast to the Gildan brand. The first thing I noticed, was that the cotton used was rough, like hay rough. Maybe they processed the cotton along with the rest of the plant to save money, who knows. All I know, is if you're fond of softer shirts, these shirts aren't what you want. On top of that, their fit is ridiculous. I'm of skinny-ish athletic build, and the sleeves at the shoulders squeezed my arms, which bunched up the shirt needlessly; while the neck was too tight, as well. I'm a size large, and have been most of my adult life; and these shirts fit like a medium or similar, even before washing them. Combined with the rough hay-like fibers, these shirts were horrible.

The material is great, but its like they sewed two back halves together and forgot that the neckline in the front of the shirt should be lower. This must mean that they sewed an equal number of shirts together using two front pieces. Or their design doesn't include having a front or back to the shirt. There is no tailoring whatsoever in these shirts. Worst shirts I have ever purchased. I tried all three out and only had them on for a minute before I knew these were really poorly made.

RVXAQ3L28Z736,Bananas for Crocs,5,positive,Polly W,,12/02/2025,"The design on these shoes is amazing!

I have not noticed any slipperiness and they are fairly easy to walk around in. I always wear socks with mine, and I do not walk particularly long distances, however. I am not sure that I would recommend doing this – walking long distances or walking in these for hours on end. I can also see how if by some chance you chose to run in them, these Crocs would possibly not hold up well, or could hurt your feet.

I believe, based off what I read – and based off what I have seen – as having been what Crocs were initially used for (boating shoes?), that they would not make good athletic shoes.

The sizing is perfect for me. I wear a size 9.5 in sneakers. But with the Classic Crocs, I chose to size up. This leaves plenty of extra space for my feet, but not so much that there is a fall risk.

Many might find if they wear half sizes that it is helpful to size down instead. But sizing up led to my Crocs being more comfortable for me personally, overall. I have average-sized feet.

They aren’t super wide or narrow, and purchasing Crocs cuts down on foot pain and such. I should add that I suffered a foot injury a couple months back, which I am not fully recovered from. These shoes are heavenly compared with most shoes I have worn.

Normally, when outdoors for only a few minutes in my other shoes that are not Crocs, I experience some foot pain or discomfort immediately after. This has not been my personal experience with Crocs. Although these particular ones may be slightly less durable than another pair I own, the Stomps.

I am absolutely bananas for Crocs!
Lol.

R1DAF1J7Z9YSKY,"Comfort, Durability, and Style – Yellow Crocs are a Game-Changer!",5,positive,Elliott S.,,02/04/2025,"I’ve been a long-time fan of Crocs, but these yellow ones have truly won me over for both their comfort and style. I’ve worn them on multiple occasions, from casual outings to quick trips around the house, and they’ve held up beautifully while keeping my feet happy the whole time.

The comfort is unbeatable. The Croslite foam construction offers soft cushioning with every step, making these perfect for extended wear. Whether I’m running errands or standing for long periods, my feet never feel fatigued. The adjustable strap in the back allows for a custom fit, keeping them securely on my feet without feeling too tight. The arch support is surprisingly good for a casual shoe, which is a huge plus.

Despite being made of lightweight material, these Crocs are incredibly durable. I’ve worn them in various environments—wet and dry—and they still look brand new. They’re easy to clean (a quick rinse with water and they’re good to go), and the soles offer excellent traction, making them suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. They’ve handled everything from beach trips to quick walks without showing any signs of wear.

The bright yellow color is a fun, bold choice. While Crocs are known for their quirky style, I find the yellow to be surprisingly versatile. It’s a cheerful pop of color that can complement a casual summer outfit, or just add a bit of flair to a laid-back day around the house. They’re perfect for anyone who wants to stand out with something more playful and vibrant.

These yellow Crocs are more than just a fashion statement; they combine comfort, durability, and style in one easy-to-wear shoe. Whether you’re lounging at home, heading to the beach, or running errands, they’re the perfect footwear for effortless, all-day comfort. I couldn’t be happier with my purchase and would highly recommend them to anyone who values comfort and a bit of fun in their footwear!",Uintes State

ROWCOGZ3RODKG,Newbie Croc wearer answers common questions,4,positive,Lacie,,16/08/2023,"SIZING + FIT: 1) I wear an exact women’s size 8.5. Sometimes size 9 so I can add a Dr Scholl arch insole. I ordered these Crocs in two different sizes so I could try them and return the size that didn’t work. The size women’s 9 was too large/loose. The size women’s 8 fit me best, but not perfect. 2) The right shoe is somewhat larger & looser than the left, and the heel strap is longer. 3) I tried inserting a Dr Scholl insole in these Crocs. It did make the shoes more snug on my feet, and added arch support. The insoles stayed in place. But, it just felt wrong to put an insole in a Croc shoe since I bought these for orthopedic comfort & support, so I removed them. 4) My husband also just ordered these exact Crocs from Amazon in size Men's 11. He normally wears a size 10.5 or 11 shoe. They fit him okay, but they are somewhat loose on his narrow feet and he ends up walking duck-footed, with his toes pointed outward, to keep them from slipping.

COMFORT: 1) After reading A LOT of reviews, I concluded that the comfort of Crocs are unique to each person. People with wider feet seem to really love them. People with foot or back problems love them. People with narrower feet aren’t usually impressed by them. 2) I sit & stand at my desk all day and these shoes are more comfortable than flip flops, but not as comfortable as high quality sneakers. 3) I have high arches and these shoes are tolerable, but don’t really offer much arch support. Perhaps my feet will eventually mold to the rubber – time will tell. 4) These Crocs have a slight cushioned insole. They are not hard plastic, and the insole has a little bit of cushy give when I take a step. 5) When wearing these shoes for extended periods, I notice pain in the ball of my feet - metatarsals. 6) The little nubs inside these shoes are soft enough that they don’t bother me or hurt my feet. That says a lot because I have very sensitive feet! 7) I find these shoes to be more comfortable and slip less when I wear them with socks. 8) I have a knock-off brand of Crocs with removeable orthopedic insoles. Those were initially comfortable on my feet, but the longer I wore them the more my feet hurt. The knock-off brand cost MORE than these Crocs ($33 vs $26).

LOOKS + COLOR: 1) Well, what can I really say here except I really didn’t buy these for looks. They look like wide orthopedic shoes. Oh yeah, that’s because they are! Comfort overruled style in my case. 2) I bought some cute white flower charms on Amazon and that made my Crocs look more feminine and added a little something that was needed. 3) I ordered these in the color CHOCOLATE because I wanted a neutral color that didn’t draw attention to my huge orthopedic shoes. In the listing photo they look kind of sparkly, but they aren’t. They are a light, soft brown, almost a taupe color. Later, IF this shoe style grows on me (remember, I’m a newbie Crock wearer) I may try some other fun colors like pink or red.

OTHER + GOOD TO KNOW + TIPS: 1) As other reviewers mention, these shoes squeak as you walk. Each step is “squeak, squeak, squeak…”. 2) In my opinion, Crocs are not ideal for narrow feet like mine. The shoes feel loose and I had them slip off while walking, which could be hazardous. I would not walk in these shoes for long distances or on uneven ground or on steps. 3) I heard that Crocs can be loosened or tightened using a blow dryer or in a clothes dryer. I tried to tighten mine using a blow dryer on high heat, held 6 inches away, then let cool. I was hoping the material would slightly shrink, especially the heel strap which is too loose. Unfortunately, this heat method did not work for me. *If you try this, USE CAUTION so you don't ruin your shoes! 4) I read many reviews where people said their Crocs shrunk or warped when left out in the sun or in a hot vehicle , so keep that in mind. 5) The holes in the plastic help ventilate enough that my feet don’t get super hot. Yes, my feet sweat a little in these shoes. There is a slight foot odor when wearing without socks. That is to be expected with rubber shoes. 6) I prefer to wear these shoes with socks because it helps with sweating and my feet don’t slip as much. 7) The tag on these shoes says Made in China. The bottom of the shoe is imprinted with Made in China. They have a tag that warns about riding on escalators and holding children’s hands at all times. I would never wear these on an escalator, but there must be some reason they include this tag – probably because of known issues of the rubber soles getting stuck on escalators. 8) I have no idea if these are “authentic” Crocs because this is my first pair and I have nothing to compare to. I checked the official Crocs’ website and the shoes I received from Amazon look exactly like those on Crocs’ website. 9) At the time of this review, I paid $26 for these Crocs on Amazon. This same style on the official Crocs’ website is priced much higher at $49. Amazon offers a lot more color options than Crocs’ website. 10) I found where Amazon sells a slightly different style of Croc brand shoes that I might try “Crocs Unisex-Adult All Terrain Clogs with Adjustable Heel Strap”. The adjustable heel strap may help in keeping my feet from sliding around. That style is a lot pricier at $41.

IN CONCLUSION: As a newbie Croc wearer, I am not totally convinced these shoes live up to all the hype and amazing reviews I read. Like I said, I don’t think these are ideal for my narrow feet. I don’t feel safe wearing these outside my house because my feet slip in them so much. I will most likely wear these inside my house, inside my RV or around the campsite. PS- I am really disappointed that these didn’t meet all my expectations, and I am envious of all the people who rave about these shoes.

I paid full price for these Crocs and was not compensated in any way for this review. I hope you found it helpful.",Uintes State
R2L1KN85UM89DU,Non-macho shoes..,5,positive,NetMechDB,,23/03/2025,"These shoes are so comfortable. This is probably my third pair. I wear them inside of the house. And I did slip on water once. But it's only happened once in the last three years. The downside is, well, they look like Crocs and for a guy. That may be. Tough to handle. To be honest. I don't wear them in front of my friends and even when I check my mail I take them off. And my mailbox is attached to my house right outside my front door. I just can't risk it. It was delivered in a box wrapped in a plastic bag. And even though it was box was wet, the bag was completely dry. New line this is my third pair so I will definitely buy more. As needed, I use them for recovery from plantar fasciitis.",Uintes State

They're comfortable for him he loves them they last pretty good and he's really hard on his shoes they're not very expensive and he absolutely loves him. Personally I don't like them that much I don't like the texture that's on the bottom of your foot it feels funky to me so I won't wear them but my son really loves them and my daughter she enjoys them too I don't know how these shoes got so popular but my God they are. I'm not complaining because they're not very expensive and it keeps me from having to buy $200 pairs of shoes for my kids just buy them a $30 pair of Crocs two to three times a year and they're happy.,Uintes State

My last pair, I bought about 1.5-2 years ago, lost the tread on the bottom so it was time for a new pair. Ordered these and they were quite a bit snugger. I thought it was all in my head. It had bought the same size as last time but I thought it was in my head. I went to a local shoe store to get something and the salesperson confirmed that she also recently had to get a new pair and she had to size up as well.

R24KXWGYB1OHYM,"Bought these for my husband on these, he loves them!",5,positive,Citlaly,,12/01/2025,"Comfort: These clogs are exceptionally comfortable, thanks to the lightweight Croslite foam construction. The molded footbed provides excellent arch support and cushioning, making them great for all-day wear, whether indoors or outdoors.
Durability: The material is highly durable and resistant to wear and tear. These clogs can handle various environments, from the beach to the garden, without losing their shape or quality.
Versatility: Crocs are incredibly versatile. They’re suitable for casual outings, gardening, or even as house shoes. The slip-on design with an optional heel strap ensures they stay secure when needed.
Style: The design is iconic but polarizing. While many love the quirky, functional look, others might find them less stylish compared to other footwear options. However, the wide variety of colors and customization options with Jibbitz charms help personalize the look.
Breathability: The ventilation holes ensure excellent airflow, keeping your feet cool and dry. They also allow water and debris to drain out, making them perfect for wet conditions.
Easy to clean: Crocs are super easy to clean. A quick rinse or wipe removes dirt, and they dry fast, making maintenance a breeze.
Price Vs. Value: While the price can vary, they offer great value for the durability and comfort provided. Some may feel they’re a bit pricey for casual footwear, but their longevity makes up for it.",Uintes State

R2UKT30C8UID9L,First impressions + update,5,positive,Customer Review,,09/09/2023,"I only just received my pair and these are my first pair of crocs. I got them for around the house, yard and garage. I’ll wear them a bit more before I do a full review on them but I just wanted to make a comment on sizing. I found a lot of varying opinions on what size to go with for someone with half sizes. I am men's 11.5, slightly wide feet, with most shoes and I went with the 11. They fit perfectly. A little wiggle room in the toes which I don’t mind. No slipping or discomfort. I almost always just slip them on and go on my way because they fit well enough that I don't need to use that little ankle strap but with that strap, I feel like I could run in these things. That's how well they fit me. So if you’re trying to decide on whether you should go up or down a size, I, personally, would recommend going down.

Update 10/9/2023 (4+ weeks later)

So after a little more than a month of wearing these daily, they have become slightly more comfortable due to the break in period. I wear them every day, usually around the house, and it's probably about an hour of total wear a day. It took me about 2-3 weeks before I really started to notice they were breaking in and shaping around my feet so I guess that you can expect them to shape to your feet after about 15-20 hours. Comfort and fit were never an issue but I definitely notice a difference between day one and today. They're softer underfoot and just seem to fit better now.

Not sure what else to really say about them. They fit well, strap up or down, they're going to stay on my feet. The comfort is great especially after the break in period. Plenty of grip on the soles.

If I wanted to complain, and this is about as nit-picky as you can get in my opinion, I would say they've already developed a crease on the sides from me squatting down in them which seemed to happen a little quicker than expected. I don't care about creases but some people do. Creases are going to happen on shoes and if you care, you probably go out of your way to avoid them (which I do not) in which case you will probably be fine.

I plan on buying a second pair so I have a pair for in the house and a pair for yard work. I'm not sure I would pay 40+ dollars for them, although they're probably worth that, but I purchased these for 32 dollars. I'll keep an eye on some different colors to see if the price will drop below 35 and, if so, I'll purchase them without hesitation.

TL;DR: They're comfortable, especially after the break in period. They fit very well (I'd recommend half sizes go down) with straps up or down. If you're on the fence, I'd recommend you purchase them on sale and you won't be disappointed.",Uintes State

At 5’6” 150pds…it’s nice finding a shirt that isn’t long and ends at the waist. I also like the feel of the fabric. However, I’ve noticed the quality is super questionable. Stitching coming out open arrival or after one cold wash and air dry, paint or adhesive was on one upon arrival, pilling after one wash. The majority of the 10ish I bought have these issues. They aren’t going to last and aren’t worth more than the 11ish dollars I paid for them. It’s too bad bc they are great otherwise.",Uintes State

The fit is decent, though it’s slightly short, and it’s soft—nothing exceptional, though. The biggest issue is the pilling. After just a week or two of wear, it started to pill badly, and that was even before washing it! For the price, it should hold up better.

It’s a good casual hoodie, but if you want something that lasts without getting that worn-out look quickly, I’d recommend looking for a different option.",Uintes State

I probably won’t be buying from this brand again. If you need a hoodie to say do yard work or around your home, this would be good for that.

Maybe if you have chubby feet, they'll be better but much too lose for my normal sized feet. I have to curl my toes to keep the shoes on my feet, which is bad for your feet (hammertoes). Plus I know they will get looser with use. Also, the soles do not have arch support. They are soft and squishy, but that's all. I have plantar fascitis that goes away with shoes that have even moderate arch support. These do not and my heels hurt after just a couple of hours. For $10 you get what you pay for, I'll likely discard the after 6 months use. Good for temporary disposable flipflops for a beach trip or pool party, but would not buy again.",

The fit is just... off. Idk how to describe it, the foam is cushy enough but it feels thick and not molded to be shaped like a foot or anything really, so it doesnt feel like it fits to your foot, it's just hanging there and makes you feel slightly unstable and like it's going to fall off your foot because it's so light, and paired with the loose/oddly fitting fabric straps just doesn't feel nice. They feel like they will fall off easily or I might twist my ankle or something because the foam isnt supportive at all and feels unbalanced. This might make you think that I just chose the wrong size,, but the length and width of the shoe are actually a bit short, so that can't be right.,
Summary: They fit weird and feel very cheap. I paid $12~ for them. I think they should be worth $5," giving them 2 stars because at least they smell like shoes and not some other unknown horrible smell of questionable material like other products I've ordered""",,,,,,,

R2U6A7FV0NMNCT,No true arch support,2,negative,everl,,28/08/2024,"These are basic loud flip flops. They are comfortable but should not be sold as having arch support. They have a small elevation at the arch but they provide no relief or arch support if you have fallen arches or some other issue with your arch. I wear orthotics and can say there are many more sandals that have true arch support. Just keep looking. Skip these. GIving 2 stars because they are soft as I place my feet in. But no arch support, they are loose, so they flop and make noise when walking, plus they have a weird chemical smell that I'm guessing will eventually wear off.",

R1ZZ458NGKGU1O,"Cute, but too loose!",2,negative,Kindle Customer,,27/06/2023,"These were so nice at first. They are comfortable and fit as expected. I have short toes so to have the right ratio of toe and heel distribution in the thong was important to me. Usually my toes don't meet the front edge and my heels hang off the back. These were just right. I bought them to only wear in the house. But.. after a week or so, the thong material started stretching out and I kept catching the front of the flip flop on the floor and bending it under, tripping me up as I walked in them. They just kept getting more and more loose, even tried washing them to shrink the fabric hoping to get them to last but I just threw them away today! What a waste. The material was so nice and soft, but that, unfortunately, seemed to let them stretch way too much to have any longevity to them.",
R1V9UEWEI5Q9UB,Not a firm fit since the strap has some stretch.,2,negative,laura,,17/06/2024,"The band is stretchy, thereby making the shoe unstable. If it gets wet, it is even stretcher. These are worthless unless maybe a person has super wide feet. THE SOLE IS GOOD.

RQS3LEK557YTC,Think twice,2,negative,Anastasia,,07/10/2024,These are very cute and extremely comfortable. My issue is each time I wore them the soles of my feet turned black! The dye even after washing won’t stop rubbing off on my feet. You get what you pay for,
R28OOUAVRFQ4M4,Not as cute as they look!,2,negative,Denise Alvarado,,19/06/2024,"It’s too easy to get the sole of the thong caught on the floor, either sides or front.

They are a fall hazard big time!",

First time I put them on they were SUPER comfortable, both the foot bed and the fabric part between your toes and on top of your foot. The only problem is that after 1 week of wearing them at home, inside, for about 2-4 hours a day, the fabric between the toes is is unraveling in layers. At the rate it’s going, they might make it another month with the way I’m wearing them. I will have worn them for maybe 2 1/2-3 months. They were not expensive, but I still expected them to last a bit longer, especially since I’m not wearing them outside and for a full day. They are super cute and REALLY COMFORTABLE, they just need to be made better. 😟",

So, all depends on the type of foot you have.",
R2EG6ZQMY6NX9D,Not impressed,2,negative,Patricia A Palenicek,,05/06/2024,I saw these on the today show and they claimed they were made out of yoga mats and had an arch support.

R8WCRM90FWGEL,Too loose,2,negative,Ami M,,04/07/2024,The design is so cute but the foot straps are too loose. We all know getting caught in the rain can be a real disaster in a pair of flip flops.

RL9SJZWGWXJAG,Cloth straps loosened after one use,2,negative,Karen Hoang,,25/06/2024,Bought these for a trip to Mexico and after one day of use by the pool and beach the cloth straps became much looser.

R1QKBL4OOQBJEN,Not a fan,2,negative,Amazon Customer,,22/08/2024,Sandals should be easy to slide into. The material straps lay down flat when not in use. Therefore I need to put them on using my hands. Inconvenient for flip flops.,

The sizing runs much smaller than usual, even though I ordered the wide version. They also lack the soft, cushiony feel that I’ve come to expect from this line.

Williams,,11/10/2024,As an older female with some back issues I was looking for a good pair of running shoes with lots of cushion to make the jog smoother and less jarring. These are unfortunately pretty hard and stiff. I don't feel any soft cushion under my soles and they're not very flexible. So far all I've done is long walks in them (3-4 miles at a time) and they are less comfortable than my old Sauconys which were about $50 cheaper. These also run a little short. I went up a 1/2 size as I usually do for running shoes and my big toe is grazing the front end. Not worth the extra price.,

But after wearing these for about a month, the sole of the shoe is already breaking down. Unfortunately, they are hurting the ball of my foot whereas before they were very very comfortable. I wear these shoes every single day so that might be part of it but at this price point they should last for several months. I don’t run or do any heavy workouts.

R3L1VBH3V0U9UT,Different from a year ago,2,negative,Melissa R.,,29/09/2024,"Pros:
The first lasted a year with almost daily wear, some significant heavy duty wear. They were great wide toe box shoes, and the fit was perfect. They took some getting used to because you still feel rocks and things due to a thin sole, but mostly that’s fine. On occasion it can be a little pokey. They are SUPER slippery on wet rocks or tile, in the grocery store even.

Now for some reason the color of the rubber on the bottom this time is almost pink instead of tan. (I have the black and “gum” color)
They are definitely much less sleek with that pinkish tint

In my pictures you can see my first shoe (granted, worn and dirty) is more tan (especially on the side where it’s more original color) rather than the new shoes which are reddish pink?

The wide toe box is basically non existent on the new pair. It really rubbed on my pinky toe. There should not be a period of “breaking them in” with wide toe box shoes— so I’m sending them back. In my picture you can see my old shoe on the right is much wider. Thats how they should be. Overall— disappointing because they were shoes I would have bought over and over again until the design changes.",
RJ49R65A8W78A,You get what you pay for!,2,negative,PATRICK J FHOLER,,07/04/2025,"Buyer Beware! With these shoes, you get what you pay for. I've had multiple pairs of another brand and these don't compare. I have water shoes that I paid $14 for that have the same quality and comfort. Very dissatisfied. After wearing them once for about 45 minutes, my feet hurt so bad I had to take them off.",
RGEF9BN76WFSX,Wide toe box? Nope.,2,negative,Amazon Customer,,11/04/2025,What happened Whitin? This style used to be a true barefoot shoe with a wide toe box...not anymore. Now they might as well be Nikes. Really disappointed. Bring back the old design!!!,
R1EE7UHW6IUZHF,Not for wide feet.,2,negative,Jess,,15/03/2025,"Not super white. A very slight yellowing.
These were also too narrow for my foot.
That combined with a small toe box made these not an option for me.",
R1DYJ3NEG8TH7I,Fantastic Shoe - Poor Durability,2,negative,Amazon Customer,,25/10/2024,"The shoes are great! But... I have just worn a hole through the sole of my 3rd pair in under 2 years.

The first pair lasted roughly a year. The second pair 6 months. The most recent pair less than 5 months. Note: I was wearing them all day every day under normal conditions. Not running miles and miles, or being rough on them.

I really love these shoes and would continue buying them if they would last at least a year. I understand that you can only expect so much out of a $40 pair of shoes, and that you get what you pay for. But lasting less than 6 months is unacceptable and the normal price has gone up nearly 10 dollars in 2 years, so I can no longer justify the purchase.",
R19N9JDJ56ZNDF,Quality,2,negative,Barefoot Guy,,14/11/2024,The price to get these is phenomenal. Overall I I’ve had a lot of barefoot shoes even Vibram toe shoes but they kept ripping after a year or so. I do a decent amount of outdoor running. I got these to try out and while the price is good they start to fall apart after about 3 months of running ont hem about 10 miles a week or so. You can tell the quality is very mediocre but you can’t really beat the cost. You can already see the sole starting to detach from the shoe and the inside or whatever that’s called just crumbles up inside once you run on them a few times. I ended up just taking it out. I wouldn’t buy them again,
R1MSMYZOEWLQ1T,[Lace-up variation] The heel box simply didn't work for me — [Velcro variation] Superb!!!,2,negative,M. Martel,,26/08/2022,"I was hoping the lace-up variant of this minimalist shoe would replace my worn Crocs/Croslite sneakers which I liked but found dangerously slippery and prone to wearing out extremely fast.

Unfortunately, while I loved the design, breathability, tread on this shoe, and reasonable comfort for my wide-ish feet in the toebox, I simply couldn't get the heelbox to stay secure and avoid unwanted rubbing/friction as I walked in this shoe. It wasn't a length issue (the shoe was the right size from heel to toe), nor was it a lacing issue (I adjusted the tension in all sorts of ways on the laces). It's just that the heel cup wouldn't follow and stay with my foot and would rub with every step as I lift my forefoot. Perhaps it's a design problem with the rigid side-molding in the mid-foot that's to blame? Although I thought I could adjust to it over time, on a recent 30 minute walk, I got blisters on both heels.

Although the lace-up style didn't work for me, it might work OK for you. Still, based on my experience, I can't recommend it.

That being said, I have a pair of Whitins barefoot trainers that I love and highly recommend — the style with the Velcro strap, tension string/cinch style lace and more of the Vibrams look). Although the velcro-equipped shoes are not stylish, which reduces their versatility, the comfort is exceptional and I highly recommend them as versatile zero-drop fitness shoes. I've hiked, shot baskets, jogged in them on grass and pavement, done kettlebell and bodyweight training, etc. They're not lightweight as far as minimalist/barefoot shoes go, and they're not stylish. But they seem quite durable and the comfort is great.",
R1FSWEE97NTTMH,Made of worse material now,2,negative,Amazon Customer,,06/12/2024,"These used to be very flexible and allow for greater movement. I used to get another pair every ~6 months or so for a few years.
This last year, the pairs I have are more stiff. They are using a less flexible material and it is less rubbery. The rubbery nature was the point, and now it's gone. They downgraded for some reason.",
R3I73HL4DYN9ZW,Uncomfortable,2,negative,Kindle Customer,,21/12/2024,"Maybe I'm not used to the type of shoe. But they were the most uncomfortable pair I've tried. I also am able to feel everything I step on, so gravel roads or rocky hills would be a challenge. I walk all day for my work and these did the job but not how I'd prefer.",
R1Q6JK9ASUO7DF,You get what you pay for,2,negative,Michael P.,,16/12/2024,Comfortable but I don’t think they’re gonna last long. First workout doing mountain climbers and a lot of the tread ended up on the floor. Same when jump roping… pile of tread after 15 minutes. Comfortable but cheap.,

Simple/elegant design.

Price is good.

Cons:

They're light weight because they offer no support whatsoever. This is fine for sprinting or running on the front of the foot, but the moment you start jogging and hit the back of the foot, it becomes uncomfortable and even painful real quick.

Due to the lack of structure/the fact that these shoes are flexible, it feels like tying your shoes doesn't actually do anything. I can remove the shoe while it's tied very easily by just bending the back off. This is both due to the flexibility/lack of structure, and the shoelace placement not being high enough on the shoe to actually be useful.

Bottom line, I bought these shoes to run in, and when I run in them, it hurts. It makes me not want to run, and definitely not run with these shoes on.",

RMB8174DLCD0C,A change in manufacturing?,2,negative,mgier,,30/09/2024,"I had previously bought a pair of these shoes exact size and color and they fit great. Apparently Whitin has changed the shoe because they now have a more narrow toe box, not what I wanted. I am used to the wide toe box of their old design, this pair will be sent back.",
R2QUQV0UPZ6M98,Talking points.,2,negative,Raymond Febles,,10/08/2024,"I mean the overall look is a number on itself, but as far as being a work shoe, this model wasn't built for grip on smooth surfaces. It probably does its thing on the streets and dirt road, but the soles quality is subpar, I mean you can feel everything through that sole, no cushion what so ever. I mean that's great if you're looking to possibly toughen your souls, but there has to be a better way.",
R1I69FSNZUXDEF,Normal size toe box and not barefoot,2,negative,Ben,,24/09/2023,"I was excited about these shoes as the title states they have a wide toe box and they’re “barefoot”. When i tried them on for the first time I was sorely disappointed. The toe box is similar in size to the DC Anvil as you can see in the picture.

I also found the shoes to be tight around the middle of the shoe even though i ordered a size up. There’s also an arch support. If you look at the bottom of the shoe you can see this arch is built into the soles of the shoe. My feet love flat soles and any bit of an arch support hurts by the end of the day.

I wish these lived up to the features in the name as they appear to be made well and are a great value for the money. Sadly they’ll be returned due to the issues above.",

R1ASLSNLF3WAAN,Not comfortable for wide feet,2,negative,Seku,,16/03/2024,"I was excited to give these a try base on the reviews. The packaging came in sealed plastic that I thought cheapens the product in my opinion but nonetheless, proceeded to try them on assuming the fit will compensate.

-The fit felt similar to water shoes where the elastic snaps at the ankle.
- My toes were tightened towards the front
- The right foot was slightly tighter than the left
- The rubber grip on the floor made slight suction sounds as I walked my house
- The look was not flattering for me or my spouse whom I asked for opinion

I was not impressed. They are minimalist but not wide enough to give the natural feel as if were barefoot. I returned for a refund.",
R32JTF8JYS8JYA,Disappointing Durability: A Review of 'Long Lasting' Shoes,2,negative,Robert,,27/09/2023,"I recently purchased a pair of shoes on July 16th that claimed to be long lasting, but unfortunately, I have already worn through the heel. While the shoes are comfortable and look great, I am disappointed in their durability. As someone who walks daily with my dog and works in an office, I need shoes that can withstand daily wear and tear. My ASICS typically last me about a year before showing serious signs of wear, so I was hoping for similar longevity with these shoes.

Overall, I cannot recommend these shoes for anyone looking for a durable option. While they may be comfortable and stylish, they simply do not hold up to daily use. If you are looking for a shoe that will last, I would suggest looking elsewhere.",

The pull loop on the heel also immediately feels like it would rub my ankle raw if I used no socks or socks that didn't cover it.

Overall, a disappointment.",

I love the shoes. They’re light, comfortable, and fit perfectly. However, the rubber on the balls of both feet have already worn flat and are close to having holes worn through. There are no other imperfections or signs of wear.

I wear the shoes daily, to include the gym and they’ve worked as well as I’d hoped, but not nearly as long.

I cannot recommend these shoes if you intend to use them for daily wear.",

The shoe is completely flat and impossible to run in, for myself anyway! I actually had the thought that this might be a good squat/deadlifting shoe however, with the elasticity of the upper body, I found my feet were moving too much regardless of how tight I laced it!

I ended up just using them for longer walks, found that I could literally feel the tiniest imperfections in my environment... Pebbles, twigs, cracks, you can feel it all. Might be great for a ninja, but I'd rather have the comfort and support!

At the end of the day, I used these and still use them as river shoes, they work really well for rafting and kayaking!",

I bought a canvas pair and this pair. The canvas is holding up great and have worn those alot more than these. The only problem I have with these is the cheap rubber the laces come through. I've only worn these 4 times and the lace ripped right through the rubber. I'd probably get another pair but not sure how I feel about the lace set up on this particular pair.,
R17KCK9LT8E4KG,Wears out fast,2,negative,Connor and Cassidy G.,,10/07/2023,The sole of the shoe is very soft so it will grip well but will wear out quickly. I’ve had them a month and the tread is already 1/3 gone. They also act exactly like socks in the sense that they roll if you are standing on the side of a curb for example. I wanted to try these instead of Xero since I wanted to see how long they lasted in comparison but idk. The Xero were just a tiny bit more comfortable and these shed inside. But I will say that these are barefoot shoes and will get the job done but aren’t good for durability or running.,

Trust me - these things are cheap and the material binds and pinches the top of your foot every step you will take.

I wanted a shoe with some cushion, stability and support and didn't want to spend a ton. These shoes are basically like aqua socks in that they have a nearly flat rubber sole without any real cushion. They look good and have a minimalistic mesh/fabric upper that seems comfortable and breathable, but the sole is just not going to do it for me. I wouldn't even want to be walking or standing for any extended period of time in these. They in no way resemble the comfort of sneakers I am used to. Will be returning.",
R2I7SQAA3G63P5,Inner Heel bump,2,negative,D. Ta,,20/05/2024,I had to return these shoes because they were not comfortable. The inner foot has a bump that felt uncomfortable to walk/run.

R2JN75T69IYWIF,Super small,2,negative,Kitty Bell,,31/07/2022,"I am a women’s size 10, which usually translates to a mens 8.5. I got the 9. And they are waaaay too small.

These are unwearable to run in, especially for a minimalist shoe. I wanted a shoe that wasn’t going to cram my toes, because that’s how I kept getting injured. I do not recommend running in a shoe that puts pressure on your toes— your toes should be able to flex and help you run with proper form.

So I’m going to order a size 10 (my running shoe size in women’s sizes). My first thought was “is this like vanity sizing for men?” Lol. If you need to see a bigger number on your shoe to feel good, this is the shoe for you… as someone who just wants a shoe that fits, it’s annoying.",
R1859FRVHBOO8E,Not barefoot shoes,2,negative,Morgan,,29/12/2023,"Though marketed as a barefoot shoe the toe box is fairly narrow. They are snug fitting in a good way, my foot feels very secure. They slide on like a sock. I would like for the toe box to be wider to be more like a barefoot shoe.

But wow this shoe is tight on the toes. I bought the same size as I would any other shoe and these were just awful. Toe box is smaller than standard running shoes. I can't recommend these shoes at all. If you really need some for cheap, then try a size or two up from what you normally wear because their sizing is definitely not accurate. I could see them being a good pair of shoes for the price if they actually had their sizing on their listing. So, for now save your money and wait until they put their sizing on their listing.",

R1MU1YD1QI0RG6,Narrow toe box and smaller than listed.,2,negative,Christopher Miller,,18/12/2022,"Everything about them is smaller than it should be. They aren't shaped well, they have a particularly narrow toe box, and aren't what I would call barefoot style shoes.
When using a tape measure, they are smaller than the label, and they are too small for my feet.
They might be constructed in a relatively durable way, but that is undercut by not being built to scale.
Stubbornly I tried to wear them anyway and suffered great foot pain because of it.

If you order these the you probably should order a size or two up from your natural size and have narrow feet.",
R33GNZV20GKRRF,Not barefoot shoes,2,negative,A-Line Powersports,,02/12/2023,"These are not true barefoot shoes. There is a curvature in the arch and It presses against your foot.

However, it does not have a wide toebox, the heel is narrow so if you don't have a narrow heel, it feels awkward to wear. The soul curves up around the arch, so if you don't have a narrow foot, it feels awkward to wear.

Dont buy if you really want a minimalist/barefoot shoe. If you have a narrow foot, and want a lightweight shoe, it will be adequate.",
RKQLES89U9MY5,NOT A TRUE ZERO DROP SHOE!,2,negative,Kindle Customer,,30/03/2021,"2 things that have resulted in the low rating. First I wear a size 13 in theory that should translate to a size 47 per WHITIN sizing chart. They sent me a 46... I can cram my feet in and the fabric is stretchy enough for them not to really hurt for short periods. So I'm not bothering to send them back.
Secondly and most importantly in my opinion. These shoe have a tiny heal rise. Having been wearing some form of zero drop shoe for the last 4 plus years. That tiny little heal rise is almost so annoying that I can't ignore it. Which is weird because I have 2 pair of traditional hiking boots that I can wear all day without issue. But the itsy bitsy heal on these shoes drives me bonkers.",
R29P9SY3KQKVAL,They do Not last Long,2,negative,Anteramian,,04/12/2022,"I loved these shoes. They were comfortable and slimline, not bulky. I was excited when I got them and they were really comfortable. I wore them non-stop for about two months. I was really upset when I went to pull the lace to tie them and the top eyelet on one shoe snapped. The area that the eyelet goes through is rubber and I can not figure out how to repair it. The eyelet is poorly reinforced. If you use these for active situations they will likely endure the name fate.",
R10GVHMND39MXQ,Cheap,2,negative,tdg,,26/08/2023,I find these shoes to be uncomfortable and cheaply made. They are very light weight. That might be their best quality. I wear them biking and they are good for that. Walking is the worst. The reason is the sole of this shoe is thin. You can feel every peeble and stone. The top of the shoe is fine.

However, after only two days of jogging in them, the left shoe started to rotate sideways on my foot.. as in the big toe side of my foot started moving off the shoe-bed to the point where I was almost walking on the fabric part of the shoe. If I kept using them I am certain it would have rotated to the point where I WOULD have been on the fabric completely. I’m not sure if it’s just my gait or if I got a defective shoe, but that was my experience. The right shoe was fine.",

However everything else: The fit with socks, the fit without socks, even trying to get the shoe on, is far, far too small. If you do feel the need to order them; order two sizes bigger than what you wear.

The only other off-putting thing was that it was likely these have been returned prior to me getting them, because they came with no box, shrink-wrapped in plastic and tossed into a Amazon shipping bag. The only thing that made it convenient, was that it was bagged for return.",

The problem is that they are expensive !! Anyway tried these ones for the cost. As usually the reviews and ratings on amazon do not provide a realistic view of what they are calling a barefoot shoe. A shoe that comes with support is not a barefoot shoe !! Another thing to consider is that this shoe is extremely slippery on wet surfaces up to a point that it's really a hazard !!

They were at a pretty good discount and I fell for good photography and not enough insight on the stability of the shoes. The shoes themselves have no arch support they are very flimsy.

R2BHHLKT49FSHS,The underwear is a very loose fit,2,negative,Elton M. Glover,,08/04/2025,"I bought this model of underwear because Hanes is usually the brand I wear (usually briefs). I decided to try out this style since I figured it could be better for workout situations.
I was pretty dissatisfied with this style. The cotton material is decently constructed ,and allows breathability, but it is too easily stretched out, and it does not keep anything in place. The underwear is a very loose fit. I ordered the appropriate size, as the waistband is a good fit and comfortable, but everything else is not great. I will not be buying any more of this style. After a single use I'm ready to just toss these away even tho I bought a 5 pack.",
R2OV6R5HH5FCJW,Disappointing,2,negative,D. Glasser,,31/03/2025,"I'm generally a fan of Hanes products, but these boxer briefs really miss the mark. Maybe it's my body type but they are snug in all the wrong places, loose where they should provide support, and the fabric feel is rough and unappealing.

I purchased these after many years wearing Champion boxer briefs due to better pricing, but clearly you get what you pay for and I will be getting rid of them and buying the ones that I know fit and feel better.",
R3UG2JT5JEY0YP,Uncomfortable,2,negative,Eric,,25/03/2025,Leg band is tight and without elasticity so it is uncomfortable against my leg if it rides up at all (such as when sitting down). Not sure why Hanes changed their design as these are the same product I purchased not more than two years back. Those fit much better and are rare more comfortable. Will look at other options if these end up in the recycling bin. Really poor design imo.,
R1VUD9II6NSM4Y,Definitely disappointing,2,negative,Michael Manzella,,14/03/2024,"I have slept in Hanes boxes for years, but I wanted to switch to a boxer brief for sleeping. My daily boxer briefs are ridiculously comfortable and made of a mesh/poly material (sold by a different company) which helps because I am extremely hot natured, but for night I wanted something more on the cotton side and less expensive. I decided to go with these since I'm familiar with Hanes and the reviews were decent. Unfortunately, they have been a disappointment. I decided not to return them since I had already tried them on, and they are at least serviceable"" for my overnight needs. Let me explain.",
Because I am only using these to wear at night and I've never worn boxer briefs at night, I'm going to stick with them until they wear out enough for me to need something else, but I definitely won't buy these again. If these were my daily boxer briefs I would 100% return them. Maybe I'm spoiled because my daily boxer brief is absolutely perfect, but I have no idea how anyone would find these comfortable for daily wear. I know that if I tried to wear these to work or during workouts that it would drive me crazy. So, two stars because they are at lest wearable for sleeping,," but I do not recommend these particular boxer briefs.""",,

Lasted only 4 washes and they totally fell apart. That's just crazy after Only Four Washings. Also the Shape wasn't even comfortable at all and that's long before they fell apart.",
R3JMMZ0X4RATTM,Thin Underwear ~~,2,negative,Jeff,,15/04/2025,"Unfortunately Hanes does not make underwear like they used to. Thinner material then you would expect and with close to a 100% cotton you would think a better thickness, that is not the case. Unfortunately if you're looking for hands underwear from 2000 to 2018 you're out of luck. I've switched to Costco/Kirkland underwear, perfect waistband, cotton blend perfect fit for the 40-42 guy.",
R1ZRL7XQL1RZMG,Not made for thick athletic legs,2,negative,Chris,,10/02/2025,"Wasn’t very impressed with the warehouse packaging of this item. No actual manufacturer packaging at all, which literally had me questioning if these were legit or knockoffs. Also, the thought of “were these returned and then repackaged?” The fit of these isn’t that great if you have athletic legs. Not comfortable at all. Actually, makes the fit of these appear to be smaller than the actual size. I probably wouldn’t order these again from here. Also, can’t return because of the type of product. So, basically just donated to “Hanes”. If you have athletic legs, I would look for something with more of a stretchy band for comfort.",
R25QV75XFWLCCY,Not the same Hanes I grew up with,2,negative,joseph,,21/03/2025,I grew up with Hanes. I just bought this package of underwear and I'm incredibly disappointed. They're so cheap you can see through them the thigh band is not elastic it's a tight string that snapped and now they're all loose. I'm not at all pleased. I used to love Hanes.,
R2YB0UGHUFQWF6,"Low quality, low support",2,negative,Eric Eiswerth,,22/02/2025,I can’t understand why this product has such good reviews. I can only conclude people haven’t experienced comfortable underwear before. The fit is awkward and not uniform and changes as you wear them. They are snug for 30 seconds until the elasticity evaporates. The material is thin and extremely low quality. After 5 mins of wear the butt is sagging and overall support is non-existent. These will make good rags for the garage.,
R2IOFI2VAS504I,Poor quality/bad stitching,2,negative,Ilia520,,12/04/2025,"My husband had been wearing these for less than two weeks before the waistbands started separating at the seams on several of them.

R3SY504G2Y9Q07,Weird shape,2,negative,DG for Border Terrier Ruckus,,31/12/2024,"This could be my own fault but these were loose in the waist but very tight on the thighs. I go to the gym so finding any bottoms that fit my waist, butt, and quads is difficult. This can sometimes be expected as most clothes are not designed for people that go to the gym, and don't skip leg day. Anyway, Also very long. Awkwardly long for boxers. I may have overlooked some details when purchasing but just a warning that they're loose in the waist, tight on the thighs, and strangely long.",

These were like wearing a pizza box. The material was NOT soft on my skin... it wasn't abrasive, but it wasn't that soft feel like you get from a nice Tee shirt. Also, the tailoring was laughable. It's like they sewed a handkerchief onto the backside. It tight across the butt and baggy in the lower back. Even move I made I felt is binding. Ludicrous! I'm a size 34 so I got the Medium. These fit like they were size 32. No kidding. In the end, I'd say even if I'd gotten the next size up their tailoring is so poor that I'd have been unhappy. These are... junk.

If I had suspenders, I’d probably need them just to keep these briefs up! All six pairs have the same issue.

Underwear started fraying at the wasteband after wearing and washing 3 times. Leg holes start out nice and snug around your legs but after 2 wearings the elastic is no longer snug.

Well, in their product description they say it “wicks away” moisture and has a new waistband that “adjusts to you.” Sounds good, but what does it mean? Well, after purchasing, I can tell you. “Wicks away” means the cloth is now so thin that it cannot absorb any moisture but just passes it along to your dress clothing. This is the opposite of why you wear underwear. The “adjusting” waistband? That means they are using less elastic and the waistband is less substantial.

R20MFG3ENXIVIY,Watch review after 2 years,3,neutral,Alan L.,,19/10/2024,"I bought this watch exactly 2 years ago. For the price (about $15 at the time), it was not bad. There are a few quirks with the watch.

1. The watch reset itself once in a while (I think about 4-5 times in the past 2 years)
2. The light is not so great so it is hard to tell the time with the light on.
3. Hard to tell if it is on 24 or 12 hr time because the text is hard to read. I cannot tell if it says am/pm or 24 hr.
4. The wrist strap is starting to break (which is why I am on Amazon looking for another watch - not sure if it is worth the money to replace the strap).
5. It's hard to see the time at an angle.",

RDLUZBFLJRP99,It’s ok,3,neutral,Travis T,,23/10/2024,"For the price it’s fine, it looks good and does what it’s supposed to. Only problem is, it’s extremely easy for you to accidentally press the button against your hand that switches it from normal time to military time.",

Not really keen on the display. It can be hard to read without angling it to the light just right. It also runs slow. I set it to the time clock at work and within a day or two, it's 5-15 seconds behind again. Isn't it's main function to keep time?? So as much as I like how it's built, I wouldn't buy another one on account of accuracy.",

R2LR0E4VY8ZBZN,Reliable watch. Band doesn't last very long though.,3,neutral,B H,,13/03/2024,"I've had this watch for two years now. In general, everything about the watch itself works fine. The only issues I've had is the rubber band holder breaking and then eventually the band itself. It's worth noting that removing the band to replace it isn't very easy because I had to cut it off. That being said, I actually prefer this watch over many others so replacing the band is worth it for me. Also, as the watch isn't designed to be waterproof, it's worth noting that I wash it off periodically without issues.",

R5CF1YVQOM54Q,It's Not Water Resistant,3,neutral,JPie612,,28/06/2023,"So, I like this watch and have for the better part of the year that I've owned it with few complaints. I do a lot of work outside but I routinely wear gloves and long sleeves so the watch doesn't get much exposure to the elements.

Still, in the last few months, I've found the face fogged up and now there's condensation inside the screen making it impossible to read the time. I bought it last Sept 2022; it didn't last a year. My only other gripe is the placement of the watch buttons. They are placed in a way that makes it very easy to jostle from work gloves or long sleeves. I found myself constantly turning off the alarm that set itself inadvertently from my movement. I don't think I'd buy it again. I need something more reliable.",

It looks great with the gold. The band doesn't bother me, it's comfortable and looks fine. It's the numbers on this watch that are SO dim, very difficult to see the time. And the backlight doesn't work well at all, it's very dim. My other complaint is trying to set the time/date, etc. is NOT easy. Read info, watched videos and still was not easy to set the buttons. Really shouldn't be so difficult for such a 'simple' watch. I don't think I'd buy this again because of its poor lighting and setup process.",
RXMR5CSSY8P9R,keeps resetting ;-;,1,negative,Snackaroo,,19/04/2024,"When my first watch got worn out I ordered a new one with the expectation that I'd like the new one as much as the old one. But the second watch keeps resetting to 0:00. Date, time, and everything is reset and I have to keep changing it to the correct time. The point of a watch is to tell time it's the one thing it should be good at why does it suck so much when the first one was so good and now my return window has closed and the resets are just getting more frequent it happened twice today. aaaaugh

old review: I've had this watch for about a year and except for some minor scratches has help up fantastically. I’ve used it in the shower and swimming with no problem. I have bone thin wrists but even with it’s large face it fit perfectly! Unlike other watches I’ve had, it had two bands to keep the excess band from hanging loose (A bigger thing than you’d expect). Keep in mind that the face is pretty large, however I have gotten way too many compliments on it. The large numbers would also be useful for someone with poor vision.
The only issues I’ve had is that the buttons don’t mean the usually things that they do on other digital watches so you’ll have to memorize a new setup. The brightness on the light is low but it’s never been an issue for me.",

R1EIOHGA4PKWK6,Stops working,1,negative,Juan Ordonez,,23/02/2025,"I've owned 2 of these watches because I like how they look. They don't hold time accurately, often drifting 10-15 seconds per day. The first one I bought broke in less than a year due to water damage. The second one I bought lasted less than a year too, when it started jumping to significantly different times randomly without touching any buttons. I would reset the watch, and the issue persisted so I eventually thew it away. I bought a Casio now, and never looked back. Night and day difference in quality when it comes to durability, accuracy and longevity.",

It does at least seems to keep time accurately. There are far better options for the same price.,
R3M5RIK2R32D7O,Frustrating purchase,2,negative,Robert,,16/08/2024,"The watch is not water resistant. Even laying beside the pool, the screen filled with water. The band stained a nasty white-charcoal color.

R2QJBAYGMU2KNK,Numbers so poorly lit that the watch is unusable!,1,negative,AT,,30/04/2022,"I just got the watch. Literally just opened the package. I’m very disappointed in the watch.

I’m a student surgeon in the US. I needed a cheap but reliable watch to keep track of time between patients and other routine metrics. Unfortunately, even in the brightest lit room, the numbering in this watch is so dark that it makes the watch unusable. And in a room that’s only slightly dim, you can’t read the numbering in the watch at all, unless you tap the little button that lights up the watch, but that too is very faint and only lasts for about 1 to 2 seconds before it turns off, leaving you with unreadable digits. I was so excited for this thing. I should have trusted the negative reviews who say the same thing.

If you take a picture of this watch with an iPhone or other smart phones, it will take a picture that presents the digits much brighter than they actually are in person. So I had to turn off the special effects on my iPhone to make sure the picture showed reality, but even the picture I’ve posted here, with my skin lit fairly well, actually shows the numbering in the watch brighter than they really are. In reality they are darker than they appear here, much less readable than they are as shown.

I don’t have time to mess around with Amazon returns. I’m in the hospital for 150 hours per week.",
R8RU953YO4TCM,YUINK Men's Ultra-Thin Watch,3,neutral,dannyboyinaz,,10/05/2023,When I put this watch on my wrist to a comfortable position (it being tight enough) the end of the watchband stuck out on the side of my wrist (about an inch) and it looked very strange and was uncomfortable.

RYZQ7XXCWUMJ5,Updated Review,3,neutral,L E WILLIS,,07/03/2022,"After I threw this watch in the garbage, I retrieved it the day and decided to try to make it work despite the band and lack of decent instructions. After wrestling with it for awhile, I was finally able to figure out how to set it and after some massaging, I was able get the band to catch and lock in place. It is still an awkward watch which is hard to read because it is black on black and the light is very dim when pressed. At least it is working somewhat which is why I updated my review.",
R2AV5FP37XWW8X,Band gets really off-color,3,neutral,Becca,,04/08/2021,"Initially I loved the look of the watch. But soon after wearing it, the white band started to get discolored (shown), and I haven't been able to find a way to get it white again. It looks gross. You also have to have the the watch face pointing right at you to be able to read the time well. Again, I like the look of the watch, but the band is terrible quality, and I would not recommend it. Not the white band, anyway. So far it has resisted water well. I have swum with it on a few times with no issues.",

Over all I love the slick design and simplicity of use but buying a 3rd would have me worried since I originally purchased it for its affordability. Like I said, I might have just been unlucky.",

But it is only viewable at about a 45 degree angle from directly above it, so a quick glance at my wrist didn't work. People who have a more natural substantial twist to their arm/wrist when viewing a watch should find it to be good, but not for me.",
R1F7B7XDZKKG7I,Hard to read & bulky,2,negative,Karina,,07/09/2021,"I got the navy blue watch with the darker screen. The numbers are not bright so you cannot read the time at all unless you click the nightlight button.

It’s also very thick and not breathable. The band is more than half an inch thick and the plastic is heavy. I washed my hands a few times while wearing it and the water stayed underneath the band, had to remove to fully dry hours later. The watch is a bit bulky/clunky overall, so I found it very uncomfortable.

I appreciate that it has many features (including the nightlight) and says the day of the week on the face. Simple and straightforward, but overall not worth it. I will be using it as a clock to be added to my hiking backpack/ shoulder of my hydro pack, but not wearing it like a watch.",

Although my favorite part of watch is the faceplate, it tells you the day of the week with letters and numbers, digitally, the appearence is liked. I also like how the watch is reflective to see, when adjusted to sun, to check the time without covering with your hand.

Backplate coming off twice is my only issue complaint, sent it back once. Days to return expired for 2nd return. Screws came out back plate, needs bigger or longer screws or maybe just snap in, instead of screws.",

The watch is a bit bulky and the straps are kind of short . The watch looks cheap. After dropping the watch on the floor the wrist straps came apart and it was annoying to put them back on. The glass casing cracked a tad bit, but that held up. If you’re looking for a cheap watch to just tell time then this is great for you. If you want something more upscale then I suggest spending a bit more and getting something different.",

R68CMB2WWRN84,cumbersome to change dates,3,neutral,Elise,,05/09/2021,Don't throw away your users manual - you will need it! Nothing is intuitive about how to set up this watch. Plus you will have to manually change the dates every few months. Best thing about it is the button that lights up the screen for you (nice when camping or when it's dark).,
R1PKSIM8V27X4F,Okay for the price.,2,negative,Daryl,,14/03/2021,"This watch looks reasonably good, is easy to read and functions as you'd expect. I purchased it because I wanted an inexpensive watch for work to tell time at a glance without fishing my phone out of my pocket every time, and one that I would not be upset about scratching or bumping. For that purpose it works well, and the slim design is a bonus.

However, the pin that holds the wrist band inside the watch body has a nasty habit of popping out if you bend your wrist a certain way, or accidentally bump against something. It's very cheaply put together, and I would not recommend this watch for anyone who plans on wearing it while being physically active, or plan on getting a nicer wrist band if you do.",
R3LK8OH94O6WS8,Came broken,3,neutral,Kelsey Freelove,,01/10/2021,This watch was pretty much exactly what I was looking for HOWEVER it came broken. One side of the strap was disconnected.

R1EOV9SYKAT87F,Watch breaks if dropped.,2,negative,Amazon Customer,,01/03/2022,Strap was a little loose and fell on laminate floor. So it wasn’t something hard like concrete. In fact it was a dance floor that is padded with springs beneath. Fell off during class and just went 0:00 for good. Opened it up and tried to remove the battery and replace it to fix. It worked for a few seconds and it was over.

R2ZYP724NXL87Y,Dim display,3,neutral,Hangtown Mark,,30/06/2021,Very nice watch with a decent band. Too bad it has a dim display and almost unreadable in normal light. If they had gone with a white background instead of black it would have been better.,

R19KRIBOZHEEHN,Every unit is garbage.,1,negative,Jd Mitchell,,29/04/2021,"UPDATE: We gave them another chance with a replacement watch and the second had the exact same issue. The button that’s supposed to activate the backlight does absolutely nothing. High quality for sure.

Just don’t waste your time or money on a company with a name like Yuink, because that is clearly just another name for Junk.

Like others have mentioned, it is too dim to read outside of a dark room. It is supposed to have a button for a backlight per the description and instructions, but the button doesn’t actually do anything.

We’ve ordered a replacement in hopes that the next one will be better, especially since the watch looks surprisingly nice, pretty much just like the pictures.

This one? I must have bumped it against something, but I didn't even notice it. Now, the LCD screen is completely haywire and unusable.
Even before this thing broke, I noticed that the four buttons were all pretty garbage. They're finicky, need more force to press than you think, and the time-and-date adjustment cannot go backwards, so if you overshoot you have to go all the way back around. And the seconds count while you're adjusting, so you have less than a minute to adjust the minute before the watch pushes it forward by one.",

The fit is absolutely terrible. I wear a size 10.5 in every other pair of boots, shoes, slippers etc that I own. All the reviews said these shoes fit perfectly. Well that's absolutely incorrect. They fit like they are a size 10, my big toe hits the very end of the toe box, no wiggle room whatsoever. They are also extremely tight on the top of the foot and cut off circulation causing tingling and numbness in my toes within 10 minutes of just wearing them sitting down. The heel cup also doesn't even remotely cup properly, your heel will just slip up and down no matter how tight you sinch the laces. They also aren't as breathable as I thought they would be seeing as they are made of entirely of mesh. These shoes are an absolute joke. Do not trust the 4 and 5 star reviews because that's what I did and now I'm out of $40. You're better off going to Walmart and getting a cheap pair of shoes there. If I could give zero stars I would!",
R2RSDQ0GFYPPZ3,"wet floor no traction, hurt your feet and no support",1,negative,Mark M.,,15/02/2024,"Pros:
Stylish Design: The shoes have a sleek and modern design that looks appealing.
Cons:
Poor Traction: The traction on these shoes is severely lacking. I found myself slipping on various surfaces, which was not only frustrating but also potentially dangerous.
Lack of Comfort: These shoes are incredibly uncomfortable to wear for extended periods. The lack of support and cushioning resulted in sore feet and discomfort.
No Arch Support: I also noticed a distinct lack of arch support, which exacerbated the discomfort and made walking in these shoes a painful experience.
Overall Impressions:
I was extremely disappointed with the Bruno Marc Men's Mesh Sneakers Oxfords Lace-Up Lightweight Casual Walking Shoes. Despite their stylish appearance, they fail to deliver on crucial aspects such as traction and comfort. The lack of support and cushioning makes them unsuitable for extended wear, and the poor traction poses a safety risk.
Final Verdict:
I cannot recommend the Bruno Marc Men's Mesh Sneakers Oxfords Lace-Up Lightweight Casual Walking Shoes. Their lack of traction, discomfort, and lack of support make them a poor choice for anyone looking for reliable and comfortable footwear.",

I got the Bruno Marc Men's KnitFlex Craft Mesh Oxfords Sneakers Casual Dress Lace-Up Lightweight Walking Shoes.
---------
I purchases these walking shoes for our Japan vacation because of all the walking we're planning. Unfortunately, I had to throw these shoes away 2 days into our trip because the back of the shoe kept scraping my heels. I tried to put a bandaid against my heel but that was only temporary. I eventually just threw them out instead of bringing them back to return to Amazon.

They were comfortable for walking but that issue with scraping my heel just was so uncomfortable. I won't buy these again.

Unfortunately, I couldn't even return these as I didn't want to carry them back in our luggage.",

It arrived and felt too long and there was way too much space in the toe box causing my foot to slide around and the shoe to be uncomfortable and to feel like I had no traction walking across my wood floors. So I ordered a pair of size 11, the next size down. Those ended up being way too small and my toes were jammed up against the inside of the shoe and the heel and width were uncomfortable as well. I really need an 11.5 but they don't offer the shoe in that size, so I returned both. It's too bad, because I like the color and the overall design of the shoe. They are lightweight and would otherwise be comfortable, especially for spring / summer in Texas. Too bad they don't fit and don't offer a version that fits me proper.",

I bought these shoes in January and I really like the style, comfort, and so far the durability. I like them so much I could see myself buying 3 or 4 pair (in different colors) once these wear out. The only thing that will stop me from buying these again is the squeaky sole. They squeak a lot when walking on tile and linoleum, etc... If they fix this issue, they have a returning customer.",
RO83JBINR22PQ,You Get What You Pay For,2,negative,Adam,,31/03/2024,"I purchased these shoes almost exactly 1 year ago and have worn them to work (office setting) daily. I wanted to start my review with that comment since it seems like most of the other reviews were written shortly after the shoes were purchased. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't trust reviews from people who have only worn these shoes for a few days. Allow me to give you the real scoop:

These shoes are made CHEAPLY. Nothing wrong with that, but just know they will not hold up like name brand shoes will. There's no such thing as a good deal, you're getting exactly what you're paying for. The soles of these shoes wear down very quickly and the tread becomes smooth and non-existent. This can quickly become a safety issue as the worn down tread makes wet floors feel like an ice skating rink.
Additionally, the fabric behind your heel will quickly wear out and rip (especially if you're slipping the shoes off and on frequently). I found the support to be lackluster and I ended up needing to insert a pair of orthotics.

They're cheap, easy to clean and look decent. However, I will not be buying these again and I'd recommend you avoid them unless you're deliberately looking for a super cheap, low quality shoe. Ignore the 5 star reviews, these are not anywhere near that caliber of shoe.",
R36GE21IJXKT5N,Runs Large,3,neutral,Chuck,,07/08/2024,Since they don’t offer half sizes I had to return. I wear a 10.5 but 11 was way too big and I had to return. Shoes do not come in a box either and were smashed together and kind of messed the form of the shoe up the way they were vacuum sealed in a wrapper. I guess it would straighten out over time and with wearing them.,

These looked great coming out of the box but after a try-on the heel was weak, and the soles very slippery, I can’t imagine on a wet surface or walking airport transfers. Rather than give em a go I decided to return and seek satisfaction elsewhere. YMMV, these just weren’t what I needed.",
R2EVC85QOS9KMJ,Good looking shoe with issues,3,neutral,M Jiménez,,30/07/2024,Overall love these shoes. Comfortable and good looking. But the tongue is either too thin or the lacing is not well designed but after half a day I am getting chafe spots on my foot due to pressure points.

The big problem with the shoes is they just don’t fit well. My normal size shoe was way too big so I exchanged for a half size smaller. While this smaller size was the right length, the heel felt terrible. I tried to break them in to see if it fit better and after two weeks of wearing them I gave up and gave them away.

The rim around the sole is much more orange in person, it does not match the faux leather and makes the shoes look a little cheap. Reviews said to order down a size; I wear a 10 wide so I got a 9.5 standard. I have room in the toe but any smaller and they would have been very uncomfortable around the foot/heel so if you need wides, don't size down more than half a size if wide isn't available.Heel is very shallow, I can feel it pulling down as I walk, might break in over time.

Overall the insole is fairly comfortable, but if I didn't need these for a trip tomorrow I would return them and spend a little more for a much better fitting/looking pair. Not the best bang for your buck.",

My problems with the shoe are there is no arch support, no half sizes for 11.5, and not super great if u have thin ankles or narrow feet. The ankle area of the shoe is sort soft material and sorta wrinkles at the opening and and the laces are at max tightness in order to give me almost a snug fit (also had to wear a sock or they would be to loose). Also feel a slight pronation inward because they are so flat inside and have no arch, I never have problems with probation in other shoes. And after awhile standing in them I can feel pressure on my arch.",

The fit is absolutely terrible. I wear a size 10.5 in every other pair of boots, shoes, slippers etc that I own. All the reviews said these shoes fit perfectly. Well that's absolutely incorrect. They fit like they are a size 10, my big toe hits the very end of the toe box, no wiggle room whatsoever. They are also extremely tight on the top of the foot and cut off circulation causing tingling and numbness in my toes within 10 minutes of just wearing them sitting down. The heel cup also doesn't even remotely cup properly, your heel will just slip up and down no matter how tight you sinch the laces. They also aren't as breathable as I thought they would be seeing as they are made of entirely of mesh. These shoes are an absolute joke. Do not trust the 4 and 5 star reviews because that's what I did and now I'm out of $40. You're better off going to Walmart and getting a cheap pair of shoes there. If I could give zero stars I would!",

R1SOO9ELBHYNH7,They're okay,2,negative,Rusty Shackleford,,21/11/2022,"I usually wear a nine but they were too big. Comfortable though.

The 8 1/2 is still a little big but an 8 would be too small. It would be good enough, but I am returning them.

On the smaller pair, the right shoe has zero arch support. I already have feet problems, don't need more.

Most of the upper looks really nice, what doesn't is that nasty brown leather stripe up the back. So jarring and disgusting.

Just as bad is the side of the sole being white. Not only is white an ugly color and causes shoes to look filthy quickly, it clashes with the look of the upper - minus the nasty brown, which pitches in to ruin the look of the shoe.

There is very little traction. These are slippery on tile or wood floors.

I really don't like it when what I wear makes me look like I ride the short bus.

Even if the shoes were built properly, the nasty colors would still make me send them back.",

My main issue and why I am returning is due to the cheap elastic around the ankles. The ankle portion doesn’t form around your ankle. It causes a wavy defect on the side of the shoe and looks cheap.

R2RSDQ0GFYPPZ3,"wet floor no traction, hurt your feet and no support",1,negative,Mark M.,,15/02/2024,"Pros:
Stylish Design: The shoes have a sleek and modern design that looks appealing.
Cons:
Poor Traction: The traction on these shoes is severely lacking. I found myself slipping on various surfaces, which was not only frustrating but also potentially dangerous.
Lack of Comfort: These shoes are incredibly uncomfortable to wear for extended periods. The lack of support and cushioning resulted in sore feet and discomfort.
No Arch Support: I also noticed a distinct lack of arch support, which exacerbated the discomfort and made walking in these shoes a painful experience.
Overall Impressions:
I was extremely disappointed with the Bruno Marc Men's Mesh Sneakers Oxfords Lace-Up Lightweight Casual Walking Shoes. Despite their stylish appearance, they fail to deliver on crucial aspects such as traction and comfort. The lack of support and cushioning makes them unsuitable for extended wear, and the poor traction poses a safety risk.
Final Verdict:
I cannot recommend the Bruno Marc Men's Mesh Sneakers Oxfords Lace-Up Lightweight Casual Walking Shoes. Their lack of traction, discomfort, and lack of support make them a poor choice for anyone looking for reliable and comfortable footwear.",
RYATX4Q31PU9S,Achilles support lacking,3,neutral,Norm,,01/05/2023,"The shoe looks good and fits nicely. Only one complaint: The rear shoe that should support your achilles is very soft and not at all firm enough. In fact, it will ride up and down slightly while walking. Not very good if your walking any distance (it's sure to produce soreness or blisters). Ok for errands or very casual wear. But certainly not what I would expect from a shoe labels walking.""""",

R3MCQZYML3R8XQ,No arch support,3,neutral,Max McCann,,06/02/2022,"I would give these shoes a five star review if they had any arch support and if the heels didn't slip. I bought some arch support inserts and put them under the shoe inserts that came in the shoes. This helped but it's not the same as having native arch support built into the shoe. There is also an odd cushion at the base of the inside of the back of the shoe that makes them slip on your heel. If this cushion was placed higher up, it seems like the shoe wouldn't slip. I tried to add inserts that are supposed to keep the heel from slipping, but that didn't work. Otherwise, the shoes are light-weight, attractive, and a good value for the cost.",

- The soles are incredibly slippery on hard surfaces. Walking indoors on hardwood or tile floors, they feel just as slippery as my leather-soled dress shoes. I've already slipped once and had to catch myself on a chair. Walking shoes shouldn't be this slippery.

- When walking, my heel lifts up out of the shoe too much. The shoe doesn't fall off, I can definitely feel my heel lifting off the shoe a noticeable amount, and the back of my foot rubbing a little against the back of the shoe.
