R2PALAAI6TFDFA,"Pros:
* Easy installation.
* Good spray quality from both the overhead and handheld shower heads.
* Affordable price.
Cons:
* Flimsy construction.
* Difficult to tighten moving parts.
* Initial leakage at the pipe connection (required additional tape to fix).
Overall: This rain shower head is a good value for those on a budget. The spray is enjoyable, and installation is simple. However, be prepared for potential leakage and a slightly less robust build. If you need a cheap rain shower head, it gets the job done.",3,25/03/2025,United States
R3L6U6PSXIYTIR,"The first few times using it the stream is awesome!! It comes out just like a rain shower. After though, the jets get clogged. We have a full house water filtration and purification system and it doesn’t create hard water. So, not sure where the issue lies at.",3,21/03/2025,United States
R3MVC57KX3HJ26,"It works great without restrictor but the holder for the smaller head , isnt very good , it slips off slamming onto the tub , it is annoying but the main head I'm happy with and installed so I'm ot returning but being more cautious about that next buy",3,08/04/2025,United States
R3UYPWQEV6JHRS,"Got here quick, easy and convenient to install. The WAND is high pressure, the main shower head is a low pressure rain style. Not what I wanted, misleading title and description. It works, doesn't leak, so you get 3/5 stars.",3,26/03/2025,United States
R3DUI9YX2553QI,Es una buena regadera al principio pero al poco tiempo deja de salir el agua de la shower head grande. Cosa que nunca me había pasado con ninguna regadera.,3,01/04/2025,United States
R10584NPJGT9HO,"I’m guessing it is probably due to the size of flow, the amount of holes, but the pressure isn’t very good",3,07/04/2025,United States
RDY7RXF2OK8LV,"Easy to install, looks great, and instant upgrade to the bathroom decor. It has great water pressure from each option by themselves. However, when using it in combo mode, the water pressure is non existent. This is due to the water flow actuater installed that restricts the flow to 1.8 gallons per minute. I returned after discovering this flaw.",3,01/03/2025,United States
RTDBDWV4FPZ09,"Shower head was great.... for about a month, then a constant drip. Product returned.",3,26/03/2025,United States
R335G1643A12CJ,"Overall, it’s a nice shower head for the price. I was very underwhelmed with the pressure from the rainfall shower head though. I don’t think it’s my water pressure in general because the handlheld shower head works great. The whole thing was fairly easy to install, took me about 20 min by myself. I got it together with no leaks on the first try. The only thing I would change is the water pressure coming from the rainfall portion.",3,09/03/2025,United States
R3CR7PXIMK75L1,Works ok. But immediately started spraying in weird directions not straight.,3,01/04/2025,United States
R1DL009W7BWM2R,"Tried to save a couple bucks because of the water in my area shower heads go bad in about a year, liked the shower setup but it is cheap so spend a little more and get the bigger one with the adjustment and it’s made to last a little longer",3,07/02/2025,United States
R17BYZUT1R1BV0,It’s been only 1.5 months since I started to use the product and it’s been already giving malfunctions. Some holes are not throwing water or drips only. I don’t think it’s useful .,3,16/02/2025,United States
R11KTT9EIRZPVP,"It was extremely easy to install, I did it by myself in 10 minutes and I'm not even that handy. Looks nice and easy to clean. Switching between different modes is easy to use, and the pressure is great for both the handheld and the shower head.
However, a huge issue for me is that less than a year later only 1/3 of the little holes in the rainfall shower head are working as intended. Some of them don't have water coming out at all and some of them spray the water every which way. I don't wash my hair every day and would like to keep it dry while I'm washing my face. This 360 water spraying leaves me and the whole area around the shower soaked. I clean my shower and the shower head regularly and never had such an issue with a rainfall type of installation before. I tried cleaning the holes with a toothpick and a brush but nothing seems to have any effect. So the only solution is to replace the whole thing, which I will do, but not with this brand.",2,11/03/2025,United States
R1EVAB7HR23PQV,"I’m speaking only on water pressure here. I came looking for any shower head that would dump the most water. Couldn’t find anything that anyone said was above the rest, and this one was a best seller that said high pressure so I tried it. The water fall is about a 3/10 and the hand held head is about a 6/10 which is still worse than the old one I had. The multiple settings is cool, it switches between the over head and the hand held really smoothly. Quality product, but go elsewhere if you want some power!",3,25/12/2024,United States
R4Z0RV8KDJU2L,It is a little small to be considered a rain shower head. But the shower extension is a nice addition.,3,27/02/2025,United States
R2Q5CWX2YNP8ER,No Content,3,02/04/2025,United States
R14NTUHCH4LSTS,"This showerhead came nicely packed and I had high hopes for it because of the great reviews but it is supposed to have 3 settings- showerhead only, showerhead and handheld and handheld only. When I set it to the middle setting for both the showerhead and handheld- the handheld has no pressure so when I set it to the showerhead only- the handheld leaks the entire time. I will be returning and am very sad about it because it is a nice looking showerhead.",3,29/12/2024,United States
RZTYM1LW14BZ8,"Overall I believe the quality and power of this shower head is pretty good. I love the rainfall and the hand held wand has strong pressure in different settings form. The wall stick was very secure however I don’t like the base for the wand, it’d be nice if it had more of a securement feature. Not just placed there to fall and get knocked down. Thats the reasoning of not 5 stars.

It would be nice if the rainfall head had some different spray features as well.",3,23/01/2025,United States
R2D4LVHF5GX3AX,It's beautiful and easy to put together.. I just wish there was better water pressure,3,20/03/2025,United States
R12DZM6GKICEZJ,The handheld wand has more water pressure than the big shower head! I'm disappointed!,3,20/02/2025,United States
RHY5S27D83U45,"Do yourself a favor and don’t gamble your time and money save yourself the headache and buy a brand that you know will work. I’ve gone through to of these now and they both have the same leaking issues from the same area in the coupling. I gave the benefit of the doubt on the first one and went ahead with the replacement option finally get some time to install it and they’re both leaking from the exact same “loose” area that allows the arm to pivot and from an engineering standpoint that is the worst ideas when it comes to fluids. Needless to say instead of the two nozzle option I get a complimentary 3 jet that spews like a geyser from an area that should be water tight. With that being said if I took some precious time out of my meager existence I could probably fix it but I’m not purely because I bought this with the intention of having a plug and play shower head and go about my life. Now please excuse me while I go and reattach my old shower head that doesn’t leak because it’s not an entire da Vinci mechanism just to hose myself off…

Edit & UPDATE***: Customer service rep contacted shortly after I left my review. They where extremely concerned with my personal qualm aswell the quality of the product they where distributing. In my personal humble opinion customer CS reaching out to me in a very professional and timely manner means more to me than a faulty piece of equipment. They went above and beyond fixing the the situation and I’m very grateful for their sincerity. With that I changed my original rating from a 1 star to a 3 star regarding their professional and timely customer satisfaction concern for their product quality.",3,06/01/2024,United States
RLGGZWW8WMDKP,No cae con presión el agua como se esperaba,3,11/03/2025,United States
R3R6PWZ2UJARB8,Feels awesome but uses up hot water VERY quickly,3,28/02/2025,United States
R2MUUCT9T9UAX9,I love the overhead rainfall feature it’s very relaxing but you can’t use both overhead and handheld at the same time because the water pressure drops significantly. I figured the handheld would have tons more pressure than the overhead but it’s not too much of a difference. Not a bad buy but I wouldn’t consider it high pressure at all,3,04/01/2025,United States
R37SCUGUN22I6Y,great but smaller than I thought,3,28/02/2025,United States
R7MJDZHJ8LITK,It is very stylish and affordable.,3,17/03/2025,United States
R3PZX95QP0XI5O,"UPDATED REVIEW:
After posting my review I was contacted by the seller and offered apologies and a full refund. It is refreshing to know there are still good sellers on-line. Although this item did not meet my expectations, I certainly recommend the seller.

ORIGINAL:
Looks nice, but not the quality I expected.
Very low water pressure and joints are flimsy.",3,23/01/2025,United States
R3U8GNLNFGS4TM,"I was very excited about this rain shower head with an extension arm. It was very easy to install, looks sleek, and it did not leak. Unfortunately, however, the pressure from the rain shower is barely there, such that using both the arm extension and rainfall at the same time is not realistic. That is without even using the pressure regulator that comes included if you need it. The arm extension has more pressure although not an impressive amount as my older shower head. The function options are also quite limited. Something odd in my experience with this shower is that I had to set the water to a much hotter setting for it to feel like the temperature that I normally use as compared to my previous shower head. This effect is even more pronounced with the arm extension, probably because of the long hose that gives the water a chance to cool down as it flows.

My bathroom is far from the water heater, and although I have never had an issue with other shower heads, this one seems to struggle with temperature regulation and driving water pressure. I think these experiences probably depend on the layout of your house, how much pressure you get, and how far you are from your water heater. It just did not work out for me.",3,12/05/2024,United States
R1S3SOY4Y3JEMN,I like it and it seems to be made well but it really lacks water pressure. We have great water pressure at our house but this makes it seems like we don't. I'll probably end up replacing just the shower head part with something else.,3,29/01/2025,United States
R3CDIORGJ3DEUA,shower head is average pressure don't be fooled by ratings . Just like any other shower head hook-up on market . listen it's all cap . our country is full of lies and company's are allowed to lie to us to make profit.,3,03/01/2025,United States
R1RAO9BD6KXVYT,The rain head isnt high flow what so ever but its nice enough for the price. The water flow won't get any soap out of your hair but that's what the hand holds for. The hand holds flow is really good and actually gets rid of all the conditoner and soap but it has a horrendous bracket that's annoying to deal with. Wish they made it so that it would actually stay in place but this is what you get for this price range. Really like being able to pause the water on handheld mode so I'll keep it but will be looking for a better bracket to keep it in place.,3,06/12/2024,United States
R22Q1LN48TRFGD,"Easy to install and works great! However, 5 months later, the water coming from the handheld piece still strongly smells of chemicals for about 10 seconds every time it’s used",3,17/01/2025,United States
R19OBFHYH9J1WE,Easy install. Valve in the handheld (the button) leaks by when not button is not pressed. Minor annoyance but it’s a cheap Amazon shower head.,3,14/01/2025,United States
R1L3EPRSC9QVI6,"I ordered Veken high-pressure rain showers last week, but I'm having an issue with the wall bracket, which failed the next day.",3,28/01/2025,United States
R1UR16QRIPC9TH,The pressure in the shower head isn't great but the pressure from the handheld is pretty good.,3,12/02/2025,United States
R2LAS31T99QN9T,"This seems like a well-built shower head. However, the controls to turn off the handheld or the main shower head aren't adequate",3,22/01/2025,United States
R1QRS5YQPCW11,Very poor streem on the big head. NOT recommended. The hand nozzel work good.,3,10/02/2025,United States
R1X46IXJQUMNA2,I was super excited to try this but was left disappointed. The rainfall head does not have enough pressure and I'm left feeling cold in the shower. I really like the handheld attachment and it's various modes but we unfortunately installed it too low before realizing we wouldn't like the main head. The heads are made of plastic and seem like they will hold up but could break easily too. Install was easy.,3,19/12/2024,United States
R3IHR623U56DX7,Misleading not good pressure,3,12/02/2025,United States
R2HPBBQBTRYR1Q,"Head work as a shower should be .
But bad Design for holder the small head. Stick to the wall ?? Naaaa that didn't work . Had to construct glue to the tile . Product needs redesigned . Can't believe that was the choice design . Whaoooo.",3,19/12/2024,United States
R2EJWO5ZDPEI9L,"I purchased this product looking for a more spa like shower experience with a relaxing rain shower; however, I didn’t really get rain. What I got was a drizzle. There’s hardly any water pressure in the rain water shower head which is a big bummer. The hand held option has more water pressure and is a better option, but doesn’t offer that spa like experience. I felt like I was being beat to death by water. I am rating this with two stars because it was easy to install.",2,31/03/2025,United States
R3FVUEOX6O73XT,"The showerhead and extension functionality are great, but the extension holder gets pulled off my shower wall by the extension after an hour or so. I tried multiple times but I don't see how to remedy this.",3,19/12/2024,United States
R2M4XS8LBCJ5L4,"This would probably work fine, but the problem is that the place to switch from shower to handheld is at the top of the pipe. I would have to get a stool to reach, and that’s not convenient.",3,01/01/2025,United States
R2VQN83SUJIKOZ,"As others have said, the water pressure is not that great. I had great water pressure before, but with this it is not so strong. It is good enough. I've notice that some of the holes work, then don't work, then work again. I recently fell and fractured some bones, so I cannot take it off to research what is wrong. I would not buy this again, but the price is low. If it lasts 6-12 months I'll figure I got my money's worth. I do like that you can have both heads spraying, not strong, or one spray which is obviously stronger. Next time, I'll purchase a name brand.",3,28/09/2024,United States
R3UE6WIJZVBWXJ,Works fine. Easy to install. The wand doesn't have as good of water pressure as the one I had before. It's also plastic.,3,22/12/2024,United States
R39DLDROSCO8BZ,"Doesn’t really hold enough pressure to use both simultaneously that well. Additionally, the most function doesn’t work. It’s a great showerhead overall though.",3,26/12/2024,United States
RO9C2SLSWYHR1,Water pressure is ok. Wand has more pressure then the head. Dont think id buy it again,3,05/01/2025,United States
R1V47WEC7ZR7DA,i dislike how the rainfall (the bigger shower head) doesn't have any other flow setting.,3,06/01/2025,United States
R1GJMIU4LV2FFU,"I actually really liked the look, quality and the ease of installation. I have VERY high water pressure so I was really excited about this product. I think it’s just how large the diameter is but it just trickles out with next to no pressure. The handheld sprayer had OK pressure but not nearly as much as the basic 2-3” head I had on there previously. I will look for something smaller in diameter next.",3,21/10/2024,United States
RD5KDBVAZ7GNR,"Absolutely love the water pressure, quality of shower heads and hose, was super easy to assemble with very clear directions! Only down fall is the adhesive on the handheld shower wall mount is unreliable. Cleaned the shower wall, dried it with a fresh towel and the mount fell off after 2 showers within 12 hours. The weight bent the handheld wall mount as it fell and now between the lack of adhesive and bent thin material, it can no longer adhere to our shower wall let alone hold the handheld shower head. I’m so bummed because I love this shower head! Will hope I can find a replacement handheld mount at Home Depot. This adhesive reminds of a slightly stickier version of a standard peel and stick sticker. The shower head itself is a dream & well worth the cost! The handheld mount in my opinion, from this experience, would benefit from a little upgrade. Otherwise I enjoy the luxury feeling this shower head provides!",3,06/04/2024,United States
RPTVQLKLKIE34,It works that's it,3,31/12/2024,United States
R2RHO2X7GG2IWP,The part that holds the extra shower handle fell off after one day of use. We made sure to clean the shower and wait for it to be dry. And we also waited 24 hrs before using this shower to ensure the adhesive sticks. We just wanted to adjust the shower head and when we moved it downwards the entire thing came off and now it won't even stick anymore. So disappointing. The pic is how my moms shower looks until we can figure something else out.,2,16/02/2025,United States
R26XOJ2JLXENWC,"Installed easily, looks sharp, high pressure with the lightweight, aluminum feeling detachable showerhead. but 4 months later the larger shower head weakened in pressure and seemed clogged. Ended up taking it down and going back to my original shower head. That worked fine.",2,28/03/2025,United States
R2YF6TFWTEY72J,"Bought this shower head after our other one broke. Seemed good. I've noticed that this one will drip from the shower head and the extension arm for such a long time after a shower. Our previous one did not drip and it's incredibly annoying. Wish the shower head itself was more square, the pressure off the arm isn't the greatest. Should have researched more before buying, unfortunately when you're in a bind, you buy the best for your budget at the time and pay for it later.",3,15/08/2024,United States
R1Z5BTLS4HL4VN,I was really excited about this shower head but I was disappointed. The water only came out of half the shower head and even then its just barley coming out it's not high pressured at all. Nothing is clogged either. Also the part that sticks on the wall to hold the other smaller shower head doesn't come off which is a good thing but sucks when you are moving and can't take that with to hold your shower head in place.,3,04/09/2024,United States
R2OISYR3IYXKJ1,Shower heads are great but thr adhesive portion to hold hand held sprayer is terrible. It doesn't stick. This makes using this item veey difficult. That's the only flaw which is major for me.,2,24/03/2025,United States
R1T224F3PXL3EB,I bought it because it said high pressured. That’s simply not true.,3,04/12/2024,United States
RIOAMKRXED5J0,Worked awesome for first three months. But then the knob that is used to adjust the angle fell off and can’t be reinstalled because threads pulled through. Which is weird because the only time it was adjusted was during the initial after installation leak check to get the desired angle in the shower. A message has been sent to seller so will see how it goes.,2,23/02/2025,United States
RG8JAM3VZDO28,"Hubby purchased this for his shower. 2 down sides. 1 the part that came preassembled was put together backwards. 2 you can use the shower head alone but you can not use the hand held alone. high end ones have 3 settings: shower head, hand held, or both together. this one is NOT high end. it only allows shower head always on and hand held on or off. So when you want the hand held to rinse your under carriage you still have water coming down on your head even if you don't want it so your conditioner can set for a few minutes while you wash and rinse your body.",2,12/01/2025,United States
R3MWNDEUSBI0MP,If you’re looking for a high pressure shower head this isn’t the one. Definitely not anti-clog either. Ive had it for about 2 months and the little holes the water sprays from are all starting to clog or spray the other way. The design and durability is very good though. Really liked it but the very low water pressure was a big nope for me.,3,21/10/2024,United States
REGQ6FQVKFDLB,"I was hoping the rainfall shower head would feel like rainfall, but the waterforce is so soft, and I don’t appreciate it. I thought something might be wrong on my water line, but the handheld head works perfect and has much better and stronger water flow. Also the installation is not as simple as they claim it to be🤷‍♀️",3,17/09/2024,United States
R1EB0ZMHEP03JS,"Nice concept, nice look. But like everyone else is saying about the pressure it puts out, not much at all. And the fact that when you turn your shower off, it still trickles on you, It doesn't shut right off. I found that really annoying. Looks nice, works, kinda.......",3,23/10/2024,United States

R1LBE3GN04T97I,"The large one is really nice, and looks elegant in my tub. The hand held piece on the other hand it a bit cheap, and the mist setting is hardly a mist, it's more like clunky jets spraying at you. If you're looking for fine mist, this isn't it.",3,14/10/2024,United States
R15C2NMU4BCQ2Z,it is easy to install but water pressure is weak,3,02/12/2024,United States
RMTKIC570PXI7,It’s nice and it’s pretty but it’s very low pressure in my opinion. Takes forever to get soap out of my hair. I’ll have to buy another one.,2,03/04/2025,United States
R3O3JG86H5HAME,I loved how big this rain shower head is. I loved how the water was falling everywhere and I was covered in warm and that the extra head was handy for spraying the walls and dogs. What I don't like is how quickly this clogged and stopped spraying. I have tried everything to unclog the spray nozzles but they basically only spray from the middle at this point. It makes me super sad because I have wanted the rainwater type of head for a really long time and it's just not feasible with this head.,2,07/01/2025,United States
R36SEVRYNO8ASF,I expected the same or better water pressure from the large shower head but am disappointed to say it's more like sprinkling rain. The smaller wand does have a few settings with enough pressure to get the shampoo/conditioner out of my hair but I wanted more from the large shower head.,2,11/03/2025,United States
RVCIFFZOKNVO9,"Overall great shower spray would love it , but thr handle holder is made to stick to the wall- it fell after 3 weeks…. So now it looks awful with cord just hanging… would not buy again",3,29/10/2024,United States
RV9USXQRZW3G5,"Maybe it’s my fault for not reading better but I didn’t realize that the entire thing is made of plastic. A little annoyed I paid $60 for a plastic shower head, if I had realized that I wouldn’t have bought it.

It seems to be working fine so far, the pressure is nice and the wand settings are good. I’m a little concerned about the longevity.",3,14/08/2024,United States
R31IC73VBZOY31,"This is second time buying this product, for some reason it didn't satisfy my need. Within a week handle is dipping! Need to return!!",2,09/04/2025,United States
R2OJ76TIJ3VD6Y,"The outer covering of the hand held shower metal covering broke off the shower head just after 2 months. This left the nylon tube inside exposed and when I tried to see if it would work, the nylon tube burst in the shower. Very disappointing. I had to attached the old hand held shower (fittings are standard) which I have had for over 5 years. I changed it out because my wife wanted a rain shower head. I won't purchase this again from this company.",3,29/06/2024,United States
RGQSDY2NIDBEE,Then constantly clogs up and water goes in all sorts of directions. Hard to clean it,3,07/11/2024,United States
RJU6UG7LZ1Q34,"bought this on prime day after reading reviews and hoped for the best.

knob turn to small head - head has great pressure.

knob turned to large head - severely lacks pressure and is a soft rain.

know in the middle for both heads - very low pressure out of both heads.

you'll want to run either or, not both. I have 52psi water pressure for reference.",3,26/07/2024,United States
R1LAM5L5CHVS5G,The hand held works well. Good pressure. The rain shower head is trash. Leaks at the connection. The middle part shoots down at a slant instead of straight down. Didnt bother me at the beginning but now half of pores are now doing it. Would not recommend unless you are trying to go cheap and dont really mind the rain head not working correctly.,3,29/07/2024,United States
RTQCAKJGJ04W3,"Purchased Aug 2024.

Easy to install. No problems there.

Ran great for a while, was a great upgrade from the previous setup.

Then, a few weeks back, it started to leak from the main shower head while the faucet runs to fill the tub.

I often switch it to the handheld just to avoid cold water dropping on my children when they sit in the tub as it fills. (It drips for about 5-10 minutes after the faucet is turned off.)

So.... for $50... I could have absolutely found a better option.

Very bummed because I really liked it.",2,09/12/2024,United States
R2I79HIY60DXCO,"First thing shipping was delayed (not happy as I pay for Amazon Prime), the photo makes the shower head look square but its a rectangle shape (not a real problem). The product is of good quality and easy to assemble.",3,02/08/2024,United States
R37BB3BK439RWA,"I wish the rainfall shower part had more pressure, right now its like a gentle drizzle. The wall bracket didnt stick well and I cannot figure out where to buy another without buying a whole new showerhead. The wall bracket did have a tolt function that was nice. This was VERY easy to install.",3,02/07/2024,United States
R2C5L06S2DPMA8,"We got the shower head and installed it already but after it was installed we noticed that it is missing the part that is needed to hold up the handheld wand. The shower head works great and so does the handheld wand but currently it is sitting on the floor of the shower. I am trying to reach out to the seller to see how I can get that part that holds the wand to the wall. We are happy with the product and even purchased a second one, not here yet, for our spare bathroom. I don't want to take it off just to return it and hope the new one comes with all of the needed pieces. I hope the seller sees this review.",3,11/01/2024,United States
RXZ8VWQ1YHKTV,"This is one of the worst shower head combos I have ever bought.

First the photos are deceptive. I thought the main shower head would be bigger. It is much skinnier than I wanted.

The handheld wand is the worst part. The plastic piece that is supposed to hold the wand is completely wrong it doesn’t hold it up well. It’s like it is not made for this set.

I tried reaching out to the seller about this but the Amazon AI chat assistant won’t let me. It only gave me the option to return it, but the return window has passed.

As a result of the poor attachment piece the shower wand keeps falling off the wall at the slightest touch and is scuffing up my shower pan pretty badly.

I do not recommend.",2,18/08/2024,United States
R2QB9V6QX1DUW0,"Loved this shower head, but it only lasted 8 months. The shower head fell randomly in the middle of the night. Lookes like it was too heavy and the connector piece broke 🙃",3,31/08/2024,United States
R2BXOAOHX7WCAX,Shower head is extremely heavy so i was only able to use the wand! You need a long heavy duty arm to put this showerhead on!,2,06/03/2025,United States

You go to wear them and they flip flops sound is so loud that you would have the attention of anyone in a restaurant or wherever you were asking that's not the worst problem though, I put on the brown ones and walked around the house for about 15 minutes and they ripped! These shoes were these ones like someone that really does not know anything about the actual foot or how to design something that your foot doesn't try to go off to the side every time and fabric is so we can feeble t's going to rip immediately.. going to have your foot go off to the Sun and you're going to be irritated by the sound! This hurts me to have to say this! My parents were in the shoe business for over 35 years in very very expensive ,upscale stores on lost soul is Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale florida! It's not quite as a skills it used to be, but I know it whole lot about shoes and fitting them and quality blah blah blah! I'm just by her hair flip flops and go from there normally but they look fine in their ad and I don't think you're going to get any good reviews on these if they actually sell any because they are a liability to your company LOL LOLlol🤣😅😍 someone in Amazon needs to put these on and try to walk with them and ..

During that time, I noticed discoloration on my feet and initially thought it was a skin issue. However, I later realized that the flip-flops were causing the discoloration. It was quite alarming to see such a drastic change in my skin. I stopped using them immediately, gave my feet a thorough pedicure, and thankfully, my skin returned to normal.

I ordered the silvery gray in my usual shoe size 8.5 thinking it was great they actually had half sizes available. When I first put them on, they felt really good and seem to fit great with a nice cushioning yoga foot bed. However, within just a couple hours of wearing them, it seem like the straps had actually completely stretched out, and the shoes were basically almost falling off my feet. That is ridiculous and absolutely should not be happening. Obviously I got what I paid for and will spend the extra money for higher quality shoes next time. These I can no longer even wear anywhere except around the house.

R24RZFZL9T2X2K,"I've purchased this shirt four times since 2020 (11 shirts), and I feel like it gets worse with each purchase. The original shirt was amazing, it was the perfect material, fit great, and had a nice collar that fit perfectly.

The second order a year later had a collar that was about 2/3rds the size as the original and the material was thinner, but it still fit nice around the neck and held up well so I got used to it. I am still actually wearing some of these two years later.

For this most recent purchase, all five shirts had collars that were thin and loose, with almost no tension. They stick straight up instead of snug around the neck, and it is so loose that it feels like I'm wearing a polo with an open neck in the front. It's almost like someone grabbed the collar and intentionally stretched it out, but it's all five shirts so I assume it's by design.

If in the description it says “ultra cotton” or “ultra soft,” in my experience that means that scratchy textured material I cannot wear. In my experience it’s been 100% of the time. The real soft ones never have said that & honestly I can’t find them on Amazon period anymore unless it’s made by a brand name like adidas or Nike. Those are a bit pricey for work tops, & I realize these aren’t, but I wish they didn’t try to pull it off as being ultra soft when no person could honestly call this soft unless they’re Tarzan dressed in straw.

RL95Z96JVOZK8,"I do not understand all the high ratings for these shirts. These fit oddly and poorly. The neck is loose, the shoulder seams are spaced way too far apart (as if made for the shoulders of someone 4 sizes larger than XL--and I do have broad shoulders), the armpits have too much fabric & are baggy, the arm holes are too big, the part over the torso and waist is not generously cut. The main part of this shirt (the part over your abdomen and waist) is seamless--no side seams. That might explain the odd cut. I have many older Gildan t-shirts that fit more normally, and made of soft cotton. I previously tried the slightly lighter-weight current version, and it was incredibly thin, but also fit terribly. This model has heavier fabric, but the fit is unusable and the fabric is rough and not soft. I compared this t-shirt to six older t-shirts that I already own--all acquired from different places and made by various companies, including Gildan. This one is far worse than my others, and the lousy fit is my biggest reason for sending them back. At one time, I thought Gildan made great t-shirts, but after I tried several current models and colors and was disappointed, I am giving up on this company, and will try another brand.",2,08/04/2021,United States

They are still hanging in my wardrobe and I just haven't felt like pulling them out and trying to wear them. Maybe one day if i for some reason don't have any clean work clothes to wear, which pretty much never happens, I might try them, but when i have better choices for shirts to wear to work, I will not wear these.

R25HFV82ITRME0,"Right off: If I had tried them on before laundering, I would have returned these shirts.

They are so uncomfortable. I got an XL because I don't like tight shirts. These have enough room in the body, but if your body doesn't completely fill out the shirt (which would make it fairly snug), it does not hang right, so it feels like the sleeves are on backward. Like this: If I have my arms straight down, it's fine; and if I move my arm backward, it's fine; but if I raise my arm forward, it immediately pulls taut on the sleeve because I don't have a huge chest pushing the front of the shirt way out.

I've been wearing XLs for a while and I've only experienced this kind of cut once, with a Hanes T-shirt. I guess if I was bigger it would make things line up properly, but then the shirt would also feel too small. I have other shirts from this brand but this cut is much different.

They run a little on the short side, which is another reason I went with XL.

They are going back. The material was thick but beyond that the size was like they were made for short men..,2,08/12/2023,United States
R6R72HKQ4FHF0,"First off, I was looking to replace 6 t shirts. I found these and they were an OK price. Pretty good reviews. The material is a bit stiff, but I have noticed that the more you wash them, the softer they are getting.
Second, the ends curl up something terrible. I have never had t shirts that curl like them. I just dont think there is enough fabric at the ends to make them not curl.

Update: after 6 months, I am disappointed in these. They have done nothing but curl on the sleeves and bottoms. It is irritating. I am going to scrap these and go with some better quality tees

Other then the t shirt curl, these are not bad. I think they may run a bit small, or maybe they just shrank a little",2,16/06/2019,United States

So, you might go up a size just to be sure. I’d send them back but it’ll cost $6 and they were only $9 to begin with. No big deal however as they were bought with a gift card.

Wrinkles from Hell. No Cotten," BEWARE. Never, Never have I witnessed a shirt that retains wrinkles like this. Upon unwrapping it, I’m hit with my first disappointment. I don’t think there is a thread of cotton in this. it has that “nylon satin” look and feel like you’re in band or something. Look for the label and all you will find is tiny tag that says “design in Italy,” of all things.
Then comes the second, and REAL surprise! I wash it and run it through the dryer for 1/2 hour and it STILL has all the wrinkles from being packaged! Another wee tag says “iron on low or dry clean for best results. Screw that,.. I’m not spending more money at the dry cleaner just to look like I’m next up with a juggling act.
No, I didn’t read the comments, and this stands as my lesson.",2,"Does not even have a tag saying J-VER"" Says ""FLEX",United States
Poor workmanship," I feel sorry for people who never experienced decent menswear.""",2,"I seldom write an Amazon review, but this one seems necessary. I ordered this shirt to wear to my son's wedding over the weekend. Unfortunately I didn't look closely enough at the shirt until I had to put it on for the big event, so I had to wear it, thankfully under a vest and with a tie covering the front. Look at the photo and you'll see what I mean about poor construction. I placed a piece of red paper behind this fold so you could see the obvious defect. I used to sell men's clothing when department stores were in their heyday. I have never seen anything like this defect in a shirt that reached the store shelves. Overall, the material quality and stitching is subpar. I do not believe the stated 65 percent cotton content in this shirt, as the tail kept creeping up and out of my pants the whole night long. Partly, I guess, this is a situation of you get what you pay for."" However I bought it based on many good reviews here. These reviews mystify me. If this is what passes for a quality shirt today",United States
Black Streaks Appeared After Washing and Ironing,,2,"Before wearing the shirt, I washed and ironed it. As I was ironing, I noticed small black streaks in a few areas. At first, I assumed it was just water from the iron and that it would fade, but instead, the streaks became more noticeable. Upon closer inspection, I realized they were appearing all over the fabric. I had the iron set to the lowest cotton setting, so overheating wasn’t the issue. I washed the shirt again, hoping the marks would disappear, but unfortunately, they remained. Returning this one and getting a more basic ALL cotton shirt.",United States
"Poor quality, no French cuffs",,2,"I was really disappointed with this shirt. It doesn’t look like the photos at all. There are no cuff sleeves or French cut details—just a basic button-up that feels low quality. The top button, which you’d use with a tie, is tiny and very hard to fasten, making this a poor choice for dressier occasions. Definitely not a high-end shirt as the listing suggests. Wouldn’t recommend if you're looking for something formal or well-made.",United States
feels like something you'd wrap a dead body in,,2,"Creepy-feeling material. It reminds me more of some sort of industrial wrapping stuff than actual cloth. I've never worn a shirt that made me feel like a plastic store display mannequin, bit this one did. And there's no pocket. The description says that but I missed it. Perhaps I've led a sheltered life, but I've never seen a man's shirt like that. Ugh.",United States
Not professional,,2,"Returned. Didn't realize this shirt would be SO SHINY. Also seemed very cheaply made.

HORRIBLE,,2,Shirt was completely destroyed and gross. Had clearly been worm and sweated in. Had food and sweat stains from the color down the front. Did not even come in any sort of packaging was just rolled up in a ball. Completly disgunting and un acceptable. Steer clear!,United States

You get what you pay for - and maybe less.,,2,"You get what you pay for. This shirt is presented as a quality fabric and is nothing more than a cheap, thin polyester.

SO SHINY,,2,"This shirt is Shiny. It is very, very shiny. It is so shiny. I ordered Black. It is reflecting so much light. It was packed in a tiny box, so that when I unfolded it, there were many creases. I put it on and looked in the mirror. Every crease and fold glimmered with a luminescent glow. It was hideous in appearance, and felt clingy even over a t-shirt. I took off the shirt and considered returning it, but I couldn't figure out how to get it back into that little, tiny box. It was a conundrum. Feeling like a fool for ordering a shirt online, and guilty for being wasteful, I threw it in the trash.",United States

Came used!!!!!,,1,The shirt came used!!!!! Stained with lipstick and smelled of cologne when I first opened it. The collar was filthy where it would’ve rubbed on someone’s neck.

But that's the best thing about the shirt. After that it's shiny with big huge collars. So, unless you figured out how to make a time machine so you can go back to the disco's of the late 1970s, this shirt is hideous. The material feels like silky plastic. Shinier than my uncle's bald head. Tacky tacky tacky.

I ordered one in navy in a XXLTall and it fit perfectly, very well made and I’m extremely pleased with it. I went onto the same site, reordered the pink in the same size as the blue. It came as an XXLRegular and it is not nearly as nice. It’s a different brand, fabric, thickness, and quality. The blue and first pink came nicely boxed and are great. This one….no thanks",United States

"Strange Fit better for a Woman, Bad stitching",,2,"I purchased a medium in white, but please note it has a purple/blue undertone to it. The material itself is very pleasant. Soft, light, and slightly silky. The problem lies with the design and quality of construction.

First- In numerous places the material was caught in the stitching and flipped the wrong direction when it should be laying flat. Also, the collar stiffness is weak. The one I received has a crumpled collar on the right side and it doesn't look like it will be easily flattened. I will need a lot of starch to keep it straight and flat.

Second- the fit. Shoulders and waist width fits slightly loose, but... It is MUCH too short. It is a length more fit for a woman. In fact, the entire look seems to be more cut for a woman, than a man. Also- the sleeves are too long (and the person I bought this for always has issues with sleeves being too short!). With the sleeves being too long and the kind of material this is? It gives the look of blouse"" sleeves that a woman would wear. (Remember ""Seinfeld's"" poofy shirt? Ha!) A woman would look great in this shirt wearing it untucked. It would fall about an inch below her hip line. NOT flattering on a guy.""",United States

Fell for the good reviews,,2,"This is a shapeless shirt. For older men who don’t care about style. It is a straight cut, is not anywhere near the body. It is essentially a potato sack. My son is 6’2” tall, 190 pounds. The shirt we ordered- sleeves are bulky and long. The body of the shirt is a square. Short, comes out of the pants. Shapeless, truly shapeless- it will work for someone who is shaped as a beer barrel. But not for someone who actually does have a male body shape. After reading the reviews I ordered two. One black one has arrived. As soon as i saw it- I cancelled the second one. I can’t believe that people actually praised this shirt…",United States

R2XDHSHFKKYDOO,"I have purchased Brooks shoes for years. My first set was a pair of Ghost several years ago that lasted me a few years. I then purchased Launch GTS about 2 years ago. I needed a new pair and have always wanted to go back to Ghost, but this new model of Ghost fits wildly different. I have always been a size 9B in Brooks. The first pair I ordered, were WAY too small and narrow. I returned and replaced them with 9.5W, and they still fit uncomfortably. I wondered if this was potentially an Amazon issue, so I took a look at recent reviews of the Ghost and even other models on the Brooks website, and there were so many recent reviews all pointing out that new models of shoes are much smaller, narrower, and fit differently in the arch. This was incredibly disappointing because I loved the brand, and I loved the style of the shoe. I think I will be moving on to other brands of running shoes.",2,13/04/2025,United States
R3FSCLMASEZRTI,"I've worn the ghost 15s for two years and they were perfect. Would walk 5-10 miles in them every day and I'm so upset they are no longer made. The Ghost 16s are horrible. Not only do you have to size up with these, but you have to go up in the width as well because they are much narrower than the Ghost 15. Not sure what the hell they did to the cushion either, but the days I wore the Ghost 16s, my knees kept snapping whenever i squatted down (felt like knife digging into knee). The days I wore the Ghost 15s, I've had no issues with my knees. Additionally, the toe box is very different with the 16s; there's some hard material in there that when touched, it'll leave a dent that will be felt by the toes and does not pop back out unless you take the shoes off and manually pop it back out with your fingers.",1,06/04/2025,United States
R39OVJO3QQSGIW,"The product I received was flawed/irregular, ie., not properly sized and with glue clearly protruding along seams. Despite the indication that the product was from the Brooks store (via Amazon), it arrived oddly packaged, the box covered in shrink wrap with information listing an entirely different company.
Returned this inferior product to Amazon and reordered directly from Brooks. The far superior product I received from Brooks, eg, properly sized and no glue visible, only further confirmed that I had received a flawed product from Amazon.
I now order directly from Brooks, rather than via Amazon.",1,31/03/2025,United States
R2H64I1VURR78P,"Brooks Women’s Ghost 16 Neutral Running Shoe. I gave them a stellar review when I first purchased them because thy immediately fit me. These were one of the top five. When I used a website for the best rated shoes that help with pronated ankles and was linked to Amazon.

I only use them for walking. I have been wearing the same style of Brooks Ghost shoe for 6 years and decided to get the updated ones for the wider toe box. I plan to go to Italy this year and thought the lighter weight would be an added bonus to pack.

In less than a week, these were showing wear. The sole was crushing down. The my previous shoe's soles, for lack of a better description, made with a dense rubber. These have a light weight, and I think low quality sole. I felt that they were stiff and I cannot imagine running in them.",1,11/01/2025,United States
R139ETY6YUIPUS,"Brooks Ghost has been my beloved walking/running shoe for years. I recently needed a new pair and purchased Brooks Ghost 16, in my usual size. I could not figure out why they weren't comfortable and kept adjusting the laces, changing socks. I finally compared the tongue of these shoes to a prior pair of Brooks 11 (see photos). The Brooks 16 tongue is lined with a different material which is thinner and rougher. It has less padding in the tongue and when the tongue bunches up it rubs and is very rough. The shoes are not wearable and I'm returning. So, so disappointing.",1,30/01/2025,United States
R1NWOQA9UES8QD,This shoe is short. I have Ghost 15. So comfortable. Ghost 16 was uncomfortable the moment I put them on. My foot hit the end and I went up a size. Why did Brooks ruin a good shoe with Ghost 15? Luckily found one to purchase. Change the shoe back please!,1,11/04/2025,United States

R2FETRK7BHO5G6,"Really disappointed in these. I bought these after reading good reviews, thinking that they would help with mild knee pain that I have. Unfortunately, they seemed to just exasperate the pain as every time I wear them my knees are sore for a day after. Additionally, if worn during workouts at the gym or doing any other activities they’re hard to balance in and wobbly. The foam sole feels lumpy and uneven. The tongue under the laces bunches up and digs into the top of my foot. I would’ve returned these right away, but wanted to wear them for a while and give them a fair chance. Definitely not worth the price. I would find something else.",1,09/07/2024,United States

R6B9I1WW3YXPJ,Very disappointed! The quality feels and looks cheaply made. The toe area is extremely short and narrow and doesn't fit like the other 6 pairs I've purchased and worn. They fit as if their a size or 2 too small. The soles are a light weight foam material that easily gets damaged from rocks or sticks or even a fingernail. The embellishment is a sticker on the sole.

R1HC757GV6UKHZ,I was excited to try these shoes as they were recommended as a brand that is comfortable and long lasting. Half of that was true. Very comfortable from the start but by the two month mark the black tread was falling off. The area under the toes and most of the foot has come off. I am walking on concrete and not rough terrain.

R23R6W0DGAMWGO,The new soles are awful. I have been wearing Brooks for many years and loved them. The Ghost 16 has a new kind of sole that is more of a plastic look and is very uncomfortable. My feet hurt and my legs hurt on the second day of wearing them. The inside is pretty flat with very little support. They have definitely cheapened the shoe A LOT! The new Adrenaline has the same type of plastic looking bottoms/sole as well. So sad because these have been the only shoes I've worn for years & now they are awful.,1,08/04/2025,United States
R3LM5QUZKVNWUK,I bought these on a 7 day try for free trial with Amazon to make sure I liked them and they fit. I actually LOVE the shoes and will be repurchasing elsewhere.

R33L19JNHHH8ST,"Updated 2/19/2025: I ordered these a 3rd time because my regular size 8 was too large, so I ordered a 7.5. The inconsistency in sizing of Brooks shoes in the same exact style and color from shoe to shoe is extremely frustrating. I really like these shoes, so I kept trying. The 7.5 is slightly short, so I was going to try ordering another pair, but at this point I’m giving up and will look for another style. Both pairs of size 8 ordered previously were too large, plus the logo on the outside was sewn on incorrectly on both pairs. I do not recommend these!

Updated review 1/27/2025: I re-ordered these, and the new ones are also sewn incorrectly. This time the logo rubs through the fabric on both shoes, so this is a defective design and/or shoe fabric. The arch support is poor, but the insoles are removable. It’s nice that Brooks changed to using athletic laces that stay tied and aren’t 10 inches too long. The toe-box of the Regular width is extremely wide, think clown shoes, with so much room that my foot slides around in the front. I love the color, and wanted so badly to get a pair that wasn’t sewn incorrectly, but that didn’t happen. Returning this second pair.

I like Brooks sneakers, as they keep me from having knee pain when I wear them, but it’s been very difficult to buy them as the sizing is often inaccurate, the fit is inconsistent, and they don’t offer the promised arch support, so I always end up paying extra to buy inserts. I bought these in Coconut Zephyr White, which is a pretty pink and cream color. It would be nice if the listed colors actually gave some idea of what the color actually is, but it’s always a surprise. I was happy to finally get a size 8 (my usual size) that actually fit, although the Regular width is SUPER wide at the front. They look like clown shoes, but I like the color. Sadly, the logo is sewn on wrong on the left shoe, causing it to rub on the side of my foot. I had to return them. I’m ordering another pair and will update this review accordingly.",1,24/01/2025,United States
R3TK55WPJI49YL,I was so grateful for Ghost 15s. I tried the Ghost 16 assuming they’d fit & feel similar. I was so wrong. What happened Brooks? I can’t wear these. The footbed is so hard! What happened to all that soft padding? All the toe room is gone. My toe hits the top of the shoe. Toe box is lower & shorter. They squeeze & cause terrible pain including the arch & heel. I almost couldn’t get my foot in the shoe at all. The opening of the shoe is so stiff & small. I can’t wear these. A bigger size doesn’t improve the fit or comfort. I am so disappointed.

R1O7EE32PALI8U,"Nice shoe. Have been buying crocs for many years. New to buying supposed authentic apparel from off Amazon or app websites. Every time I do weird situations arise, as like this. I bought 3 pairs of crocs from this website at the same time, that says Amazon selling crocs shoes with the crocs store website within the description. One of the pairs was inaccurate size and description. And as for these particular ones I bought 2 of the same size and color. It says size 9w and 7m. Unfortunately one fits extremely smaller than the other and one of them came in a crocs bag with crocs logo and product description. The other identical one came in a tear away bag with no product description. 3 pairs of crocs from this same website advertising crocs store and two out of three which have to be returned and are of the same exact shoes, color, and size that fits completely different (much smaller), than the identically purchased shoes bought at the same exact time.

As for the 3rd pair, I should’ve caught that it said men’s size 2. There is no such size as a men size shoe. Amazon/crocs are selling little kids shoes for adult prices in adult section. It was advertised as size 4w/2m adult unisex. Returning immediately. There is no such thing as a men’s size 2. I should’ve caught that.
It’s not an adult shoe. They are selling children sizes and charging adult prices. This is a kids croc.

R1GXMNW9UGS3RK,"Background: I've been buying Crocs Classic Clog, size Women's 9, for over a decade.

These look like Crocs at first glance, but there are at least 4 differences.
1. These are about one size smaller than all other Crocs of this same size & style.
2. There is an ugly bulging at the big toe, which is caused by #3 below.
3. The toe of the shoe curls significantly upward. I don't want my toes bent backward.
4. They say made in Vietnam. I called the Crocs company & was told that all their shoes are made in China.

This led me to add a #5 to this list.

5. Since all Crocs are made in China & these were made in Vietnam, does that also mean they lack the silver that is in Croc shoes? Silver kills the bacteria that causes odor, & I have noticed that any odor in them is gone by the next day. The silver is the reason I only buy Croc clogs.

Even if this company could send me a pair of shoes that aren't curled, I can't verify that they contain silver bc the only company I can call is Crocs, & they told me that if it says made in Vietnam, it isn't one of their shoes.",1,08/02/2024,United States
R321RYK3HKJLW,"Let's be real here, $55 for crocs is insanely overpriced and I wanted to bang my head into the wall when my family and I went to Marshall's and found crocs in the $25-30 range..... bought them for my job but sent the first ones back because they were oversized and the second pair literally reaches right up to my toes, I have to clip my toenails really short or else I can feel the front of the croc digging into my feet all day and pushing my nails back into my feet and it hurts :( I also can't wear any of my ankle-length socks with these because they completely slip off my feet, and the thought of buying brand new socks for the sake wearing one pair of shoes is....grrrrr.....

R37YXR42MR7GEA,"I have a pair of Crocs I bought at Dicks and wore them to and around Maui, Hawaii. The bottoms were very smooth and comfortable, but for some reason one of the straps tore and came off so I ordered the pair I'm now wearing from Amazon and they are extremely uncomfortable with nibs so long on the insoles that they hurt and make my feet ache. Being a diabetic I can't risk the crocs causing problem. I wondered about the crocs so I took them to an actual croc store in Myrtle Beach and the sales lady assured me they were authentic saying that it depends on what country the crocs are made in as to how the nibs are on the insoles. She suggested sanding off the nibs with sandpaper saying that is what her Dad did, The Croc employee was so nice, helpful, and sweet especially when I fell in the store. She only had one problem: her name wasn't Amazon. I wish I had sent the shoes back but for a swap-out but I didn't. I hoped the nibs would wear down. They haven't. In researching this particular order, I discovered the straps on the new crocs are removable, so I am going to look at removing them and placing them on my original pair of crocs. Croc Corporate is trying to help me and they have been extremely nice just like the Amazon employees with whom I have dealt. I guess I am just a balding, fat, Southern old coot who is too set in his ways about what he likes or doesn't. I look at my wife of 35 years and then at Amazon. If I was told I had to make a choice between the two, well I just I hope Amazon will be real understanding when I park my motorhome in their parking lot. Love the place.",1,16/06/2018,United States

Tighter than usual and causing a sore spot on the big toe. ( We did the hot water thing to stretch them a bit, but still not as comfortable as in the past.) 2. The color is now staining the skin!

With just a few minutes of home wear, my feet hurt. Clearly, these shoes must fit some people perfectly, but on me, they were useless. Returned.",1,15/12/2024,United States
R1W53DQWNZZOR3,I have ordered 4 pairs from here in the past and the sizes were correct. Some made in Mexico and some made in Vietnam. This time I ordered 2 different W13/M11 for my son that wears an 11. Both times they were Women’s 11. Exactly the size of my women’s 11. I need to get Crocs so bad and hat going to the mall but these are sized completely wrong. These also didn’t show the W and M size just M11 but it was not nearly large enough to be a Men’s 11. This has to be a manufacturers defect. Labeled correctly but size wrong or maybe it should have been labeled W11. Either way frustrating…I want to order several pairs in different sizes but the headache of having to keep returning is not appealing. Manufacturer needs to check their shoe sizes as they are way off. I see others have experienced the same thing. My previous ordered from a year ago or so were great. Issue with the current stock,1,11/02/2024,United States
R3L3MFGFVB4863,"For years, I resisted buying Crocs, mostly because I just thought they were so ugly. Personal taste aside, this past Summer I decided I would buy a pair to use for working outside. I am an avid gardener, and during growing season, I am always coming in and out of the yard, and I hate having to take my shoes on and off every single time so I don't track dirt into the house. When I saw these on sale, I figured they would be perfect for working in the garden.
After a couple of weeks of regular wear, I started to notice plantar fasciitis acting up. I wasn't sure what the cause was as I always wear shoes, even in the house. As soon as I stopped wearing the Crocs, the pain went away. A week or so went by and I started wearing them again. By the end of the day, the pain was back. Since I've stopped wearing them altogether, the pain is gone and has not returned.
I've recycled the old pair and won't be wearing them again.",1,26/01/2024,United States

But I left my pair out on the deck for an afternoon (this is, of course, what crocs are for) and they shrunk. Not evenly enough I could give them to someone with smaller feet, mind you, but to be like clown shoes: tiny in the back, huge in the front. amazon directed me to crocs for a warranty request, crocs sent me back to amazon, and eventually they agreed to refund me, but it took an hour lol.

RSKB6ROKYDKEY,"I have several pairs of old, original crocs and ordered these in the same size (M6W8), evergreen color. As others warned, these new crocs are nothing like the crocs of yore. They look like a shriveled version of the old crocs--narrower, shorter, and the toe box points upwards at the end. The old crocs were so loose that if you were seated you could forget they were on your feet--not so with these. They press against the top of my arch and the strap cuts into the back of my ankle. The toe box is still big enough, but the upwards angle causes my big toe joint to ache when I walk. The interior nubs are so pointy that it feels like some kind of neuropathy. Sort of like a soft bed of nails. Even when worn with ever-so-attractive socks. The material doesn't feel a cushy as the crocs that have several years wear on them. This is the 2nd pair I have tried and will now return. Made in Vietnam, for what that's worth. I assume that ordering a size up will only make them too large, and won't mitigate the other problems. Crocs, why did you have to ruin such a fine product?! Instead of making 50 million new colors, couldn't you just give us one option for an original croc?

Sizing down doesn't do much of anything to correct the fit because the width is still absurd and they feel like they are going to fall off my feet when I try to walk. Now I see that Amazon's website suggests sizing down for all of Crocs' standard clogs. Come on, I'm not going to play these silly games with shoe size. Just make shoes in the correct size and if people want to buy something that's 3 sizes too big they can do that. Returned.",1,21/07/2024,United States

Crocs are nice own other pairs, great for around the house if you haver pain in feet. Good shower shoe, and good idea to shower with them because they make your feet sweat bad which creates a smell that can then transfer to your shoes. Then you need to throw your shoes in washing machine and it becomes a lot of hassle so just make sure to check them.

The quality was not the same as others I have owned and the size is not the same. This one from Mexico though I bought my usual size was bigger somehow.

All this difference in quality caused a lot of unease for me. Had me checking if the product was genuine and lifespan of the material and what not. Turns out Crocs stopped manufacturing in Mexico in August 2018 which led me to research the Lifespan of the product. It says it should last up to 10 years if not used much. So guess I should have no issues with flaking and rotting

All am saying is quality control matters. The inconsistencies with the material and size caused a lot of unnecessary discomfort for me.

If the quality doesn't matter then your all good if you are use to comfort and right fit just verify manufacturing country if possible because it does matter",1,24/01/2023,United States

R1TN7QHJ320DHQ,"The following is a copy of my review of another pair of Crocs Classics (10M/12F) as this pair is one of three pair ordered separately but all suffering from the same defect — incorrect sizing.

These are Crocs and there's really nothing new to write about them — function over form, by a long shot, and they do seem to wear decently.

But the last three pair I've ordered from Amazon have been WAY off in size, obviously incorrectly marked.

As a size 10, I ordered three pair of Crocs 10M/12F at three different times. I received all three pair (at separate times) **marked** 10M/12F, but they were INCORRECTLY marked. They were at least one size too large, closer to 1.5 sizes too large.

Be prepared to return them if they don't fit properly, and note them **DEFECTIVE** as they are incorrectly marked.

Out of a total of four pair I ordered, only one was true to fit. Not a good record. I want to order one more pair, but I'm unsure as to whether to try again for my size or a size smaller. It may have been a bad lot and maybe now they're back on track.

I'm in my 50's, and I still have some from grade school. Couldn't believe it. Paid $40 with tax for these. Guess I got a faulty pair.

PROTIP: Check out other buyers on Amazon because some sellers on Amazon list crocs with only a one size difference in the men and women. For example (8 women’s / 9 mens), it seems odd at first because that’s not how croc manufactures them but it IS more accurate, especially for this seller!!

She's ordered Crocs before off their website, or Zappo's. The pair received are no longer cushioned in the arch and are slightly too small. She's order the same style and size through the other two providers, and these are the correct shoes. Have these shoes simply sat in the warehouse too long and baked? They're apparently not comfortable like a Croc should be so I'm returning and we'll be purchasing elsewhere. The convenience of Amazon is great, save when it isn't!",1,11/01/2024,United States

I usually get 12 to 16 months out of one pair. This pair lasted less than three months.

Makes no sense why the sizes vary just because they are made in different areas. You never know which ones they will send. I give up!

R5AB4YXZFZGGM,"Los Crocs eran perfectos al llegar: muy bien de lo ancho de lo largo y la puntera, eran exactamente la talla esperada. Los compré para mi esposo y él muy contento los estrenó regando el jardín y lavando el carro, luego los lavo y los puso a secar al sol. Esto no lo hubiera hecho porque al cabo de 2 horas al recoger sus Crocs ya eran más pequeños visiblemente y lo comprobó al ponerselos.
La verdad fue desagradable pero también muy cómico porque el talón le quedó completamente de afuera 😂. Claro nuestro hijo de 10 años se apuntó como candidato para usarlos y le quedaron muy bien siendo que él usa un #5 de niño que sería #7 de adulto. Así que disminuyeron 2 tallas.
Mi recomendación es que no los dejen al sol ni vayan a la playa con ellos porque regresarán de puntitas en ellos o descalzos con su hijo pequeño estrenando. 😂😂😂.

I held onto these for a Christmas gift and was totally embarrassed when my daughter opened them and they were 2 completely different sizes of shoes and she is now unable to wear them. We are now stuck with shoes that she can't wear and I am out of money from this purchase. I don't understand how there is nothing they can do about this considering it wasn't my fault!

Now I thought this was weird because its a FULL size up and the original ones I ordered were only JUST too small. So I compared them to the originals and sure enough, they were the exact same size despite being labeled a size larger. They were each manufactured in different countries and the 2nd pair had some weird stuff going on with how they were packaged. But idc about the packaging.

I ordered the black ones in a women’s 7. The left shoe fits great, the right shoe is about a size too big all over — like it’s it’s longer AND wider.
Nope, it’s not that my feet are different sizes either — the shoes are visibly different in size, see pics.
These ones say made in China, but in fairness, so does an older pair that I have— those ones are in fact genuine, so the place of manufacturing may not have anything to do with the authenticity as others have suggested.
I think the issue is that Crocs quality control isn’t great. I bought a pair of the heeled wedge sandals a few years back and the straps are snug on one foot not another. I thought it was my foot so I kept them, then I bought another pair of the exact style in a different color and they were perfectly fine!

All three pairs are labeled the same size. 1) This pair is much wider than they used to be, much wider than my other two pairs. 2) This pair is much shorter in length than the other two. 3) The strap is much looser with a wide gap between the shoe and the strap when the strap is in the up position.
These are my go to shoes, but I can't wear this new pair because they are so much wider. (My feet are different widths. One is regular width and the other is large width. These are too wide on my large width foot.) Having the strap stick up much higher than the shoe looks really off. Looks like it has the wrong strap on. Quality has gone downhill and it appears there is no size control now. My other two pairs are the same size, while these are wider, shorter and wonky. So disappointed.

Update: The new replacement crocs (black) don’t fit either. They are smaller than other crocs I have purchased in the same size (green).

So be careful cleaning them. You may have regrets like myself! What a waste of my money!!!

They are now “Made in Mexico” and they used raised printed lettering on the inside of the heel strap that is very uncomfortable. When my son pointed this out and how uncomfortable it would be I thought he was kidding. Sure enough I ran my fingers over it and yeah it would be very uncomfortable. Luckily I had his previous pair and was able to remove the heel strap, without any printing, and replace it on the new pair.

R10EEQE84MZUU,"I own several pairs of Crocs because I need to walk on soft surfaces but I also need some arch support. The old Crocs were absolute perfect for this. I could wear them for many hours and felt like I walking on clouds!
I just received two new pairs but, I am going to return them because, unfortunately, the inside of these Crocs are not as comfortable as the original ones: the bottom is not as soft, the support arch is not as strong, and those little bumps on top of the soles are sharp to the point of being painful. I tried to wear them with socks but I still would not be able to wear them for long hours at home or outside.
It seems that, in very recent years, some genius at Crocs has decided it was a good idea to make them more uncomfortable. Crocs have been very popular for many years not because of their looks but because of the high level of comfort they provided. I understand they felt the need to improved the look by coming up with more designs, colors, glitters, etc. but, why did they diminished the comfort? Did they think we wouldn’t notice it?
Please bring back the old softness of the sole, the supporting arch, and take the sharpness of those tiny bumps away!

The ease with which they can be slipped on and off is convenient for indoor use. However, when it comes to venturing out, I strongly feel these are not appropriate footwear for public settings, with the exception of the pool or beach where practicality takes precedence. While they are easy to clean and durable enough for casual wear, their very distinct and, in my opinion, unattractive style makes them unsuitable for general public outings. Ultimately, their utility feels limited to a very specific set of circumstances, making them a less versatile footwear option overall. I guess I'm getting old, but for what are essentially foam shoes, I also feel they are overpriced unless you can snag them on sale.",2,24/03/2025,United States

Third & final time I ordered size 9 womens. Not sure what's up with Crocs, but the foot bed fits when sitting. Take a step and my toes move forward & jam against toe box. This has happened with size 8, size 9 in Crocs as well as Nautica brand. I tried wearing socks to keep my foot in place & although it helped a tad, it was NOT the solution. I had worn them out for a day to give them a true test. Unfortunately they failed the test & I cannot return them.

R2BYW2ODDYFH7D,"I re-ordered the same Crocs I bought a few years ago. Of course, Crocs are always loose and most peoples' feet look like they are swimming in them, but that pair and a previous pair stayed on because of the way the shoe was shaped, and were really comfortable. I think the too-long length and wide footbed were actually helpful in keeping the shoe on. Now, the Crocs are shorter in length and narrower, and yet don't stay on. I believe it has to do with the length. It looks right on my foot, but my foot falls out. I wish that Crocs would keep the styles or shapes that they used to have.",2,20/07/2024,United States

R7H7X15H98QS5,"I am trying to replace my worn out Crocs and am not happy with how wide they are now. I ordered another pair first, but they were way too wide and because they were a different style, I assumed that style just ran wider. So, ordered another pair in the same style as my old Crocs, and found them to be really wide, also. My feet just kind of swim in them. You can see the difference in width, even though the sizes and styles are the same. Too bad they didn't just offer a wide version instead of making them all wide - they are not nearly as comfortable to wear now.",2,23/07/2024,United States
R27SH934YMFUVT,"Size 12 for Crocs Classic Crush Sandal was too large. My foot often slid forward. When the left front strap broke, it was beyond 90 days to return them to Crocs, 13601 Via Varra, Broomfield, CO 80020. So, from Amazon, I ordered these Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Clogs in size 11. Size 11 is too small. When the size is too small, the heel strap pulls the top edge of the sandal up and onto the skin of the foot. After wearing them two times, the sandal’s posterior edge (closest to the ankle) on the medial side (above the arch) wore my skin off in a line on both feet. I had to tape cotton on my feet over the painful wounds while wearing Beslip Women’s/Men’s Garden Clogs, size 11.5, that I bought at Amazon. In addition to the half size, Beslip Women’s/Men’s Garden Clogs have a much more accommodating curve for the top edge of the sandal. Conclusion, Crocs Unisex-Adult Classic Clogs are okay if you don’t need a half size. Otherwise, feet either slide around in them or they are too tight and create a wound.",2,23/07/2023,United States

The first size which was a 10 (I'm a 9.5) was too big so I tried Amazon try before you buy and ordered a size 9. It came slightly dirty on the bottom which I didnt care because they're crocs and I can wash them but I couldn't figure out why the 9s were still so freaking big so I ordered a size 8 to try which are a little tight. I finally looked at the bottom of the 'size 9s' and they had sent me another size 10. I went to check the black plastic hang tag, that said mens 7/ womens size 8! Wtf! The women's 8 that I received was marked on the hang tag as a mens 5/ womens 6 but om the bottom says womens 8. These are all mislabeled so keep that in mind when ordering and make sure you're sent the right ones!

Around the end of March, I noticed, my left hip started hurting, and then my left knee too, a bit. In July, I wondered if maybe it was the new shoes I was wearing every day, and decided to try not wearing them anymore. It is October now and my knee seems ok, and the hip has improved a lot. This probably would have happened with any pair of plastic shoes I had chosen. Before these Crocs, and after, I have been very happy with my New Balance athletic shoes.

More importantly, they are not made properly either. I have been lucky to have nearly symmetrical feet- I rarely find a pair of shoes that fits one foot but not the other. The Croc's right shoe fits properly, the left pinches/rubs my big toe. I took them off and looked carefully and the left one is curved inward at the toebox. Either the mold was defective, or the operator pulled them off at an angle before they were fully cured.

R20VSFFPLXAKM0,"I bought a size 9 (women) since I wear a 9 in a sandal. I wear a 9.5 in a closed toe shoe. But there was a recommendation in this description that half sizes should order down. So I thought a size 9 would be just right for me. Alas, they are too short. The end of my toes touches the front of the shoe even without a sock. So I immediately had to put them back in the box and return them. According to my experience, one would order a size up, not a size down. A 9 is too short for a 9.5 foot. Still, they are very nice and attractive shoes, so I'm ordering a size 10. I'm giving 5 stars because there was nothing wrong with the shoes, just bought the wrong size and don't think the description should have suggested ordering a size down.

Update: I have to change my rating from a 5 star to a 2 star for the simple reason that they will not work for someone like me with exactly 1/2 size off. After the above-described experience (ordering a size 9 women for my 9.5 foot), I sent them back and ordered a size 10 women. They are enormous. I can't possibly wear them even with a very thick sock. They fit me like boats. I really wanted to like these, and except for their being a smidgeon too small in size 9, I really would have liked them. I guess I have to give up on Crocs. I would guess there are a lot of people like me in between sizes who can't make them work. Much of the problem might be that when the size gets larger, both the length and the width increase. I didn't need them any wider at all, just a tiny bit longer. Too bad.",2,07/10/2016,United States

They were the most comfortable shoe for hanging around the house or cooking in the kitchen for long periods of time. My house has tile or hardwood so there isn't a lot of give there. Those Crocs were made out of a softer, squishier rubber that had a lot of give to it. These Crocs are made of a firmer material that seems like it has some plastic in it. They aren't very cushioned. They are also a lot smaller. They fit but just barely. Don't know if that's because I got a pair from Mexico instead of China (and how weird is it to be hoping you get one of the ones from China but all the reviews agree they fit better than the ones from Mexico.) Also these have anti-fatigue nubs inside. They are arranged in ridges, higher in some parts than others. You can see it's meant to be higher above the ball of your foot, under your toes but the weird sizing keeps my foot from fitting perfectly in that area so mostly I'm just walking on uneven nubs. I don't know if they work for anti-fatigue because they hurt my feet and I can only wear these shoes for about an hour at a time. I suppose it will be like when I was a kid in the summer and at first it hurt to go barefoot outside but after a while your feet toughen up and it stops hurting. Not thrilled though to have paid money for shoes that my feet have to toughen up for. They are also a lot hotter to wear than my old Crocs.

R11Y2DRG0OGUZN,"They are comfortable. But, as your feet get swollen throught the day, the inner shoe base pushes on the side of the arch and causes tremendous pain.

I want to try a 9xw but I do not think that is going to solve the problem in the arch area. It will probably just be an even wider toe box.",3,25/03/2025,United States

R2Y86FU9SVZWZ2,The quality of the shoes is fine but Brooks must have changed their manufacturer because the fit has changed. I’ve worn Brooks Ghost shoes for many years.

R37OZ434MZ33B6,"I absolutely loved the Brooks ghost 13 so when those wore out, I bought myself the 14 version. There were a few changes to that version that made it very uncomfortable, particularly with the back lip of the sneaker being curved in and rubbing my ankle and causing blisters so those went back. I went to another brand for a while, but really wanted to try the ghost again, but sadly, the same issue remains. The bottom of the shoe is incredibly supportive, but it’s very hard and after a while, it becomes uncomfortable and the same back lip issue persists. I got terrible blisters the first time I wore these. I don’t know why they changed the shoe and why manufacturers don’t realize that the back part of the shoe shouldn’t curve in.

(Why on earth do they keep doing that?). For years, I was a faithful Asics runner. Then the toe bed started pinching my feet. After some trying on lots of shoes, I found the Brooks Ghost line. I have had about 7 or 8 pairs. It feels like the Ghost 16 is tighter than my previous Ghosts (recently, a few pairs of the Ghost 15).

I especially appreciate the cushioning; walking in them feels like floating on clouds, even during long walks. Unfortunately, the Ghost 16 was really disappointing. The sizing runs much smaller than usual, even though I ordered the wide version. They also lack the soft, cushiony feel that I’ve come to expect from this line.

The first pair I ordered, were WAY too small and narrow. I returned and replaced them with 9.5W, and they still fit uncomfortably. I wondered if this was potentially an Amazon issue, so I took a look at recent reviews of the Ghost and even other models on the Brooks website, and there were so many recent reviews all pointing out that new models of shoes are much smaller, narrower, and fit differently in the arch.

Not only do you have to size up with these, but you have to go up in the width as well because they are much narrower than the Ghost 15. Not sure what the hell they did to the cushion either, but the days I wore the Ghost 16s, my knees kept snapping whenever i squatted down (felt like knife digging into knee). The days I wore the Ghost 15s, I've had no issues with my knees. Additionally, the toe box is very different with the 16s; there's some hard material in there that when touched, it'll leave a dent that will be felt by the toes and does not pop back out unless you take the shoes off and manually pop it back out with your fingers.",1,06/04/2025,United States

So far all I've done is long walks in them (3-4 miles at a time) and they are less comfortable than my old Sauconys which were about $50 cheaper. These also run a little short.

R3QODGVV0NQ431,"Title: Disappointing Experience with Hanes Underwear

Rating: ★★☆☆☆

I recently purchased a pack of Hanes underwear with high hopes, given the brand's reputation for comfort and quality. Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory, leaving me with no choice but to share my disappointment.

The most glaring issue was the poor fit of the underwear. Despite selecting the correct size based on the sizing chart, I found the underwear to be uncomfortably tight and restrictive. The waistband dug into my skin, causing discomfort throughout the day. It was surprising to encounter such a basic fit problem from a brand like Hanes, known for its commitment to providing comfortable undergarments.

The restrictive nature of the underwear also made it challenging to move freely. Whether sitting for an extended period or engaging in physical activities, the underwear failed to provide the flexibility and ease of movement that one would expect. This lack of comfort was a constant reminder of the poor fit, making it difficult to go about daily activities without feeling constantly bothered.

Another notable issue was the overall quality of the material. The fabric used in these particular Hanes underwear felt cheap and lacked the softness that the brand is typically associated with. After just a few washes, I noticed signs of wear and tear, further adding to my dissatisfaction.

In summary, my experience with Hanes underwear was disappointing, primarily due to the poor fit, restrictive design, and subpar quality of the material. For a brand that has built its reputation on comfort, this particular product fell short of expectations. I would caution others to carefully consider their options before choosing Hanes for their underwear needs, as my experience suggests that not all products from this brand live up to its well-established reputation.",1,26/02/2024,United States
R2D7GBMFJIJ0V6,"What the heck Hanes? Been buying XXL Hanes a long time and this latest purchase does not come close to fitting. Serious exposure on the back side with slightest bend. So I laid them side side with by last Hanes purchase and some Polo underwear. Photo speaks volumes. Yes, I realize the older ones stretch with age, but they were new a one point and fit perfect. How do I get my money back if I tossed the packaging because I assumed it was Hanes with years of experience fits. Stupid me, an now I need to hit or miss sizing on another brand to settle on.",1,08/04/2025,United States

One size from one brand may fit well, yet the same size from another brand may be too loose or too tight, so I know I must be prepared to try a little. So I bought a packet one size smaller than the one I had previously purchased. No luck. I had the same difficulty with the smaller size as I did with my larger size.

First the red, blue, and green: these three pairs have weird stitching along the bottom of the leg holes. Due to the stitch type, they do not stretch. I work in the textile manufacturing field with sewing operations and this is not something that I would expect on this type of clothing. I am an average size person (6 foot tall, 200 pounds) and these boxers are uncomfortably tight on the thighs. So tight that I actually debated leaving work on lunch break to go home and change. Maybe these are a good fit for chicken little or someone without legs? Also they are a little tight in other areas with very little stretch it you catch my drift.

The black and grey pairs have a normal stitch along the legs which allow them to stretch and fit. A better fit in the thighs, but still tight in other areas.

There is no band to hold them up? The band is all used and stretched out. They will be going into the garbage. This is a partner Amazon should dump if this is the quality. I guess I cannot even trust Amazon on a product review. Really?,1,30/10/2024,United States

R2IK9XROMLKC0W,I can’t return as I’ve already wore a pair but these are the absolute worse underwear I’ve ever had! They have to be knock offs or Hanes just went downhill in quality! The waistbands is cheap and material feels cheap waistband twists up instantly super long in the legs but hardly covers my butt crack the fit of these is just all wrong!

R3J7QECM2LSFEU,"The description stated something to the affect of “made to stay in place and not ride or bunch up in the leg area.” And I suppose that’s somewhat true, but instead of a stretchy material or elastic, the stitching is straight and tight, with little give. So if you have thick thighs or even just move around a lot, the legs constrain and eventually the stitching will break, leaving you with loose leg holes that ride and bunch. I wouldn’t purchase them again. 1 star because they ended up being a waste of money.",1,22/08/2024,United States

R1WILGPCMGKBL,"It's so weird to me that men's underwear manufacturers put the soft side of the waistband on the oustide and the rough, irritating side inside against your skin. These are the worst I've ever purchased from Hanes. They do not fit well, the waistband is loose (YES, I got the right size for me). I've never once in my life returned underwear, but I had no other option but to throw them in the trash.

RTMUA32IYHF45,"Rating was reduced to one star, because there is no indication of no star: Length for warmth. But no front support, just loose fitting. There is perfect feeling of fit and assurance, on the legs. But on the front, where it matters, there is the absence of feeling, the sensation of discomfort because there’s no credible specific support. Colors or style, or contrast stitching don't matter. It's what counts. The photos showing the presumption of a front, contoured support, do not 'support' the actual garment itself. There isn't any of the picture contour of the front that exists when wearing this undergarment. Candidly, it should be the form of a cup, that actually acts like like a supportive sewn in area. Akin, politely said, to a brassiere, that should have the support feature yet it's only a loose fitting fabric that offers no assurances.

I also like the feel of the fabric. However, I’ve noticed the quality is super questionable. Stitching coming out open arrival or after one cold wash and air dry, paint or adhesive was on one upon arrival, pilling after one wash. The majority of the 10ish I bought have these issues. They aren’t going to last and aren’t worth more than the 11ish dollars I paid for them. It’s too bad bc they are great otherwise.",2,03/04/2025,United States
R32UV244OSAMCA,Extreme pulling/fuzz on all areas not just high friction areas. I got these to travel. They started looking awful before I even made it to the airport.

R6ABQHOWJNOM2,"For the price and considering these just for weekend use, they are fine. If you are looking for a quality hoodie, look elsewhere.

R3CEDZB901I6AR,"I gave this hoodie as a Christmas gift to my girlfriend, and while the color (a nice teal) looks great, the overall quality is a bit disappointing. The fit is decent, though it’s slightly short, and it’s soft—nothing exceptional, though. The biggest issue is the pilling. After just a week or two of wear, it started to pill badly, and that was even before washing it! For the price, it should hold up better.

It’s a good casual hoodie, but if you want something that lasts without getting that worn-out look quickly, I’d recommend looking for a different option.",2,18/01/2025,United States
R37CO6NAHFNCWJ,"I cannot believe all the reviews that say the sweatshirt is soft and cozy because it is not soft or stretchy. In fact, it feels kind of stiff and restrictive. I wanted a big slouchy sweatshirt for my boyfriend that I could borrow sometimes. Unfortunately he doesn't like it either. He feels that the fit is too narrow and the neckline opening is tight.

I've actually bought a few hoodies from them on Amazon over the years, and the XL was much bigger in the past than it is now. What's up with that?

R2DEE4NROTMHP,"I got this as a gift, it came with quite a few loose strings sticking out, and it smelled quite weird. Nothing a wash can't fix but...I would honestly recommend sizing up. I kind of wish I had gotten a hoodie elsewhere instead of trusting the other reviews. It isn't soft or comfy, and is pretty light with lots of stray strings sticking out. I'm going to have to go through and trim all these stray strings before I give it as a gift. If I knew that this is what I would be getting I wouldn't have bought it at all.

I don’t know why, but after I cut the surrounding cellophane from the flip flops, I leaned in and drew in a big strong whiff. I threw my head back, closed my eyes, and scrunched up my face! I worry that these are unhealthy. Whatever they are made of can’t be healthy! Omg yall, gross! I even let the dog have a whiff and he literally blew out hard of his nose!",2,25/03/2025,United States
R2BNE6ECA5TFZ,"Straps are super loose not sure how I can even wear them. Maybe I got a defective pair bcuz it's not like a bit loose it's like no hold at all loose. I wanted to keep them at least for around the house but man It's actually wild. I tried to untie the knot & bring it higher to the middle of my foot.

I have to curl my toes to keep the shoes on my feet, which is bad for your feet (hammertoes). Plus I know they will get looser with use. Also, the soles do not have arch support. They are soft and squishy, but that's all. I have plantar fascitis that goes away with shoes that have even moderate arch support. These do not and my heels hurt after just a couple of hours.

R3KTMPZO0TT4AJ,"These are basic loud flip flops. They are comfortable but should not be sold as having arch support. They have a small elevation at the arch but they provide no relief or arch support if you have fallen arches or some other issue with your arch. I wear orthotics and can say there are many more sandals that have true arch support. Just keep looking. Skip these. GIving 2 stars because they are soft as I place my feet in. But no arch support, they are loose, so they flop and make noise when walking, plus they have a weird chemical smell that I'm guessing will eventually wear off.",2,28/08/2024,United States

R2LCNMHPRL7JWP,"These were so nice at first. They are comfortable and fit as expected. I have short toes so to have the right ratio of toe and heel distribution in the thong was important to me. Usually my toes don't meet the front edge and my heels hang off the back. These were just right. I bought them to only wear in the house. But.. after a week or so, the thong material started stretching out and I kept catching the front of the flip flop on the floor and bending it under, tripping me up as I walked in them. They just kept getting more and more loose, even tried washing them to shrink the fabric hoping to get them to last but I just threw them away today! What a waste. The material was so nice and soft, but that, unfortunately, seemed to let them stretch way too much to have any longevity to them.",2,27/06/2023,United States
RQS3LEK557YTC,"The band is stretchy, thereby making the shoe unstable. If it gets wet, it is even stretcher. These are worthless unless maybe a person has super wide feet. THE SOLE IS GOOD. I wish the band was made of non-stretchy material because it is not fun to grip the shoes with your toes constantly, just to keep them on. Big fail but could be good with better straps.

RCDS11QXD1G61,"It’s too easy to get the sole of the thong caught on the floor, either sides or front.

R2EG6ZQMY6NX9D,"They look exactly as pictured. First time I put them on they were SUPER comfortable, both the foot bed and the fabric part between your toes and on top of your foot. The only problem is that after 1 week of wearing them at home, inside, for about 2-4 hours a day, the fabric between the toes is is unraveling in layers. At the rate it’s going, they might make it another month with the way I’m wearing them. I will have worn them for maybe 2 1/2-3 months. They were not expensive, but I still expected them to last a bit longer, especially since I’m not wearing them outside and for a full day.

R1M46BGO6AQSU8,The design is so cute but the foot straps are too loose. We all know getting caught in the rain can be a real disaster in a pair of flip flops.

R1YF1SG28W1LJG,Bought these for a trip to Mexico and after one day of use by the pool and beach the cloth straps became much looser.

RGHC6DOVX9O2N,I own Brooks Ghost Max 2 and I really love them. But it’s a bit expensive so I went with Max 16 thinking it’s a less cushioned version of Ghost Max 2. But they are completely different shoes. Max 16 runs narrow and short and hard. Over all they are very uncomfortable and made my feet really hurt after walking for 20 min. I’d pay a little more and get Ghost Max 2.,2,08/04/2025,United States

R2SFI6V6RNU06G,As an older female with some back issues I was looking for a good pair of running shoes with lots of cushion to make the jog smoother and less jarring. These are unfortunately pretty hard and stiff. I don't feel any soft cushion under my soles and they're not very flexible. So far all I've done is long walks in them (3-4 miles at a time) and they are less comfortable than my old Sauconys which were about $50 cheaper. These also run a little short. I went up a 1/2 size as I usually do for running shoes and my big toe is grazing the front end. Not worth the extra price.,2,11/10/2024,United States

RGEF9BN76WFSX,"Pros:
The first lasted a year with almost daily wear, some significant heavy duty wear. They were great wide toe box shoes, and the fit was perfect. They took some getting used to because you still feel rocks and things due to a thin sole, but mostly that’s fine. On occasion it can be a little pokey. They are SUPER slippery on wet rocks or tile, in the grocery store even.

Now for some reason the color of the rubber on the bottom this time is almost pink instead of tan. (I have the black and “gum” color)
They are definitely much less sleek with that pinkish tint

In my pictures you can see my first shoe (granted, worn and dirty) is more tan (especially on the side where it’s more original color) rather than the new shoes which are reddish pink?

The wide toe box is basically non existent on the new pair. It really rubbed on my pinky toe. There should not be a period of “breaking them in” with wide toe box shoes— so I’m sending them back. In my picture you can see my old shoe on the right is much wider. Thats how they should be. Overall— disappointing because they were shoes I would have bought over and over again until the design changes.",2,29/09/2024,United States
R1EE7UHW6IUZHF,"Buyer Beware! With these shoes, you get what you pay for. I've had multiple pairs of another brand and these don't compare.

The first pair lasted roughly a year. The second pair 6 months. The most recent pair less than 5 months. Note: I was wearing them all day every day under normal conditions. Not running miles and miles, or being rough on them.

I really love these shoes and would continue buying them if they would last at least a year. I understand that you can only expect so much out of a $40 pair of shoes, and that you get what you pay for. But lasting less than 6 months is unacceptable and the normal price has gone up nearly 10 dollars in 2 years, so I can no longer justify the purchase.",2,25/10/2024,United States
R1FSWEE97NTTMH,The price to get these is phenomenal. Overall I I’ve had a lot of barefoot shoes even Vibram toe shoes but they kept ripping after a year or so. I do a decent amount of outdoor running. I got these to try out and while the price is good they start to fall apart after about 3 months of running ont hem about 10 miles a week or so. You can tell the quality is very mediocre but you can’t really beat the cost. You can already see the sole starting to detach from the shoe and the inside or whatever that’s called just crumbles up inside once you run on them a few times. I ended up just taking it out. I wouldn’t buy them again,2,14/11/2024,United States
R3I73HL4DYN9ZW,"I was hoping the lace-up variant of this minimalist shoe would replace my worn Crocs/Croslite sneakers which I liked but found dangerously slippery and prone to wearing out extremely fast.

Unfortunately, while I loved the design, breathability, tread on this shoe, and reasonable comfort for my wide-ish feet in the toebox, I simply couldn't get the heelbox to stay secure and avoid unwanted rubbing/friction as I walked in this shoe. It wasn't a length issue (the shoe was the right size from heel to toe), nor was it a lacing issue (I adjusted the tension in all sorts of ways on the laces). It's just that the heel cup wouldn't follow and stay with my foot and would rub with every step as I lift my forefoot. Perhaps it's a design problem with the rigid side-molding in the mid-foot that's to blame? Although I thought I could adjust to it over time, on a recent 30 minute walk, I got blisters on both heels.

Although the lace-up style didn't work for me, it might work OK for you. Still, based on my experience, I can't recommend it.

That being said, I have a pair of Whitins barefoot trainers that I love and highly recommend — the style with the Velcro strap, tension string/cinch style lace and more of the Vibrams look). Although the velcro-equipped shoes are not stylish, which reduces their versatility, the comfort is exceptional and I highly recommend them as versatile zero-drop fitness shoes. I've hiked, shot baskets, jogged in them on grass and pavement, done kettlebell and bodyweight training, etc. They're not lightweight as far as minimalist/barefoot shoes go, and they're not stylish. But they seem quite durable and the comfort is great.",2,26/08/2022,United States
R1Q6JK9ASUO7DF,"These used to be very flexible and allow for greater movement. I used to get another pair every ~6 months or so for a few years.

R88BV5WDV7AAH,"Maybe I'm not used to the type of shoe. But they were the most uncomfortable pair I've tried.

R1GL1ZRV50TST,Comfortable but I don’t think they’re gonna last long. First workout doing mountain climbers and a lot of the tread ended up on the floor. Same when jump roping… pile of tread after 15 minutes. Comfortable but cheap.,2,16/12/2024,United States
RMB8174DLCD0C,"I've been using these on and off for months.

Pros:

Very light weight.

Simple/elegant design.

Price is good.

Cons:

They're light weight because they offer no support whatsoever. This is fine for sprinting or running on the front of the foot, but the moment you start jogging and hit the back of the foot, it becomes uncomfortable and even painful real quick.

Due to the lack of structure/the fact that these shoes are flexible, it feels like tying your shoes doesn't actually do anything. I can remove the shoe while it's tied very easily by just bending the back off. This is both due to the flexibility/lack of structure, and the shoelace placement not being high enough on the shoe to actually be useful.

Bottom line, I bought these shoes to run in, and when I run in them, it hurts. It makes me not want to run, and definitely not run with these shoes on.",2,17/03/2024,United States

R95NYZ55XTR4U,"I mean the overall look is a number on itself, but as far as being a work shoe, this model wasn't built for grip on smooth surfaces. It probably does its thing on the streets and dirt road, but the soles quality is subpar, I mean you can feel everything through that sole, no cushion what so ever. I mean that's great if you're looking to possibly toughen your souls, but there has to be a better way.",2,10/08/2024,United States
R32FX1TOP99LST,"I was excited about these shoes as the title states they have a wide toe box and they’re “barefoot”. When i tried them on for the first time I was sorely disappointed. The toe box is similar in size to the DC Anvil as you can see in the picture.

I also found the shoes to be tight around the middle of the shoe even though i ordered a size up. There’s also an arch support. If you look at the bottom of the shoe you can see this arch is built into the soles of the shoe. My feet love flat soles and any bit of an arch support hurts by the end of the day.

I wish these lived up to the features in the name as they appear to be made well and are a great value for the money. Sadly they’ll be returned due to the issues above.",2,24/09/2023,United States

-The fit felt similar to water shoes where the elastic snaps at the ankle.
- My toes were tightened towards the front
- The right foot was slightly tighter than the left
- The rubber grip on the floor made slight suction sounds as I walked my house
- The look was not flattering for me or my spouse whom I asked for opinion

R2MY4P8R5XSY0A,"I recently purchased a pair of shoes on July 16th that claimed to be long lasting, but unfortunately, I have already worn through the heel. While the shoes are comfortable and look great, I am disappointed in their durability. As someone who walks daily with my dog and works in an office, I need shoes that can withstand daily wear and tear. My ASICS typically last me about a year before showing serious signs of wear, so I was hoping for similar longevity with these shoes.

Overall, I cannot recommend these shoes for anyone looking for a durable option. While they may be comfortable and stylish, they simply do not hold up to daily use. If you are looking for a shoe that will last, I would suggest looking elsewhere.",2,27/09/2023,United States

I love the shoes. They’re light, comfortable, and fit perfectly. However, the rubber on the balls of both feet have already worn flat and are close to having holes worn through. There are no other imperfections or signs of wear.

I wear the shoes daily, to include the gym and they’ve worked as well as I’d hoped, but not nearly as long.

The shoe is completely flat and impossible to run in, for myself anyway! I actually had the thought that this might be a good squat/deadlifting shoe however, with the elasticity of the upper body, I found my feet were moving too much regardless of how tight I laced it!

I ended up just using them for longer walks, found that I could literally feel the tiniest imperfections in my environment... Pebbles, twigs, cracks, you can feel it all. Might be great for a ninja, but I'd rather have the comfort and support!

The canvas is holding up great and have worn those alot more than these. The only problem I have with these is the cheap rubber the laces come through. I've only worn these 4 times and the lace ripped right through the rubber. I'd probably get another pair but not sure how I feel about the lace set up on this particular pair.,2,12/10/2023,United States
R2J6OU3AYIR1X4,The sole of the shoe is very soft so it will grip well but will wear out quickly. I’ve had them a month and the tread is already 1/3 gone. They also act exactly like socks in the sense that they roll if you are standing on the side of a curb for example. I wanted to try these instead of Xero since I wanted to see how long they lasted in comparison but idk. The Xero were just a tiny bit more comfortable and these shed inside. But I will say that these are barefoot shoes and will get the job done but aren’t good for durability or running.,2,10/07/2023,United States

They look good and have a minimalistic mesh/fabric upper that seems comfortable and breathable, but the sole is just not going to do it for me.

So I’m going to order a size 10 (my running shoe size in women’s sizes). My first thought was “is this like vanity sizing for men?” Lol.

RPQFTVOOJJTQZ,"Though marketed as a barefoot shoe the toe box is fairly narrow. They are snug fitting in a good way, my foot feels very secure. They slide on like a sock. I would like for the toe box to be wider to be more like a barefoot shoe.

I bought the same size as I would any other shoe and these were just awful. Toe box is smaller than standard running shoes. I can't recommend these shoes at all. If you really need some for cheap, then try a size or two up from what you normally wear because their sizing is definitely not accurate. I could see them being a good pair of shoes for the price if they actually had their sizing on their listing. So, for now save your money and wait until they put their sizing on their listing.",2,07/09/2022,United States
"This style of Whitin's shoes needs a wider toe box. I don't understand why they would design a shoe to look so much like a conventional ""casual"" shoe that the space in the toe box is compromised.""","This is a comfortable shoe. Low padding, easy to slip your foot into. High marks for that. Zero marks for durability. A little over 1 month after purchase, the top eye ripped and my shoe was unusable. The same thing happened on my other shoe. I wrote to the company to request a refund and never heard anything. Clearly you get what you pay for. I would avoid these shoes if you need something to last more than a month.",2,06/05/2023,United States

When using a tape measure, they are smaller than the label, and they are too small for my feet.
They might be constructed in a relatively durable way, but that is undercut by not being built to scale.
Stubbornly I tried to wear them anyway and suffered great foot pain because of it.

I can cram my feet in and the fabric is stretchy enough for them not to really hurt for short periods. So I'm not bothering to send them back.
Secondly and most importantly in my opinion. These shoe have a tiny heal rise. Having been wearing some form of zero drop shoe for the last 4 plus years. That tiny little heal rise is almost so annoying that I can't ignore it. Which is weird because I have 2 pair of traditional hiking boots that I can wear all day without issue.

The eyelet is poorly reinforced. If you use these for active situations they will likely endure the name fate.",2,04/12/2022,United States
R2PNAJBJCPK16X,I find these shoes to be uncomfortable and cheaply made. They are very light weight. That might be their best quality. I wear them biking and they are good for that.

However, after only two days of jogging in them, the left shoe started to rotate sideways on my foot.. as in the big toe side of my foot started moving off the shoe-bed to the point where I was almost walking on the fabric part of the shoe. If I kept using them I am certain it would have rotated to the point where I WOULD have been on the fabric completely.

If you do feel the need to order them; order two sizes bigger than what you wear.

The only other off-putting thing was that it was likely these have been returned prior to me getting them, because they came with no box, shrink-wrapped in plastic and tossed into a Amazon shipping bag.

The problem is that they are expensive !! Anyway tried these ones for the cost. As usually the reviews and ratings on amazon do not provide a realistic view of what they are calling a barefoot shoe. A shoe that comes with support is not a barefoot shoe !! Another thing to consider is that this shoe is extremely slippery on wet surfaces up to a point that it's really a hazard !!

The material was NOT soft on my skin... it wasn't abrasive, but it wasn't that soft feel like you get from a nice Tee shirt. Also, the tailoring was laughable. It's like they sewed a handkerchief onto the backside. It tight across the butt and baggy in the lower back. Even move I made I felt is binding. Ludicrous! I'm a size 34 so I got the Medium. These fit like they were size 32. No kidding. In the end, I'd say even if I'd gotten the next size up their tailoring is so poor that I'd have been unhappy. These are... junk.

If I had suspenders, I’d probably need them just to keep these briefs up! All six pairs have the same issue.

Unfortunately, I can’t return them since they've already been washed. They might work as rags, but I’m still deciding.

Well, in their product description they say it “wicks away” moisture and has a new waistband that “adjusts to you.” Sounds good, but what does it mean? Well, after purchasing, I can tell you. “Wicks away” means the cloth is now so thin that it cannot absorb any moisture but just passes it along to your dress clothing. This is the opposite of why you wear underwear. The “adjusting” waistband? That means they are using less elastic and the waistband is less substantial.

1. The watch reset itself once in a while (I think about 4-5 times in the past 2 years)
2. The light is not so great so it is hard to tell the time with the light on.
3. Hard to tell if it is on 24 or 12 hr time because the text is hard to read. I cannot tell if it says am/pm or 24 hr.
4. The wrist strap is starting to break (which is why I am on Amazon looking for another watch - not sure if it is worth the money to replace the strap).

Not really keen on the display. It can be hard to read without angling it to the light just right. It also runs slow. I set it to the time clock at work and within a day or two, it's 5-15 seconds behind again. Isn't it's main function to keep time??

That being said, I actually prefer this watch over many others so replacing the band is worth it for me.

Still, in the last few months, I've found the face fogged up and now there's condensation inside the screen making it impossible to read the time. I bought it last Sept 2022; it didn't last a year. My only other gripe is the placement of the watch buttons. They are placed in a way that makes it very easy to jostle from work gloves or long sleeves.

The band doesn't bother me, it's comfortable and looks fine. It's the numbers on this watch that are SO dim, very difficult to see the time. And the backlight doesn't work well at all, it's very dim. My other complaint is trying to set the time/date, etc. is NOT easy. Read info, watched videos and still was not easy to set the buttons. Really shouldn't be so difficult for such a 'simple' watch.

Date, time, and everything is reset and I have to keep changing it to the correct time. The point of a watch is to tell time it's the one thing it should be good at why does it suck so much when the first one was so good and now my return window has closed and the resets are just getting more frequent it happened twice today. aaaaugh

old review: I've had this watch for about a year and except for some minor scratches has help up fantastically. I’ve used it in the shower and swimming with no problem. I have bone thin wrists but even with it’s large face it fit perfectly! Unlike other watches I’ve had, it had two bands to keep the excess band from hanging loose (A bigger thing than you’d expect). Keep in mind that the face is pretty large, however I have gotten way too many compliments on it. The large numbers would also be useful for someone with poor vision.
The only issues I’ve had is that the buttons don’t mean the usually things that they do on other digital watches so you’ll have to memorize a new setup. The brightness on the light is low but it’s never been an issue for me.",1,19/04/2024,United States

The first one I bought broke in less than a year due to water damage. The second one I bought lasted less than a year too, when it started jumping to significantly different times randomly without touching any buttons. I would reset the watch, and the issue persisted so I eventually thew it away. I bought a Casio now, and never looked back.

R1USC6T1DE5TWU,The strap holes are a bit far apart to get a comfortable fit and the buckle exceeds the thickness of the strap so it digs in a little. The bands are not replaceable so changing the strap is not an option. It's dim in most lighting conditions. The buttons are not protected from accidental presses so I often need to fuss with it. It does at least seems to keep time accurately. There are far better options for the same price.,2,24/06/2024,United States
R4ROMSPLWWGZT,"The watch is not water resistant. Even laying beside the pool, the screen filled with water. The band stained a nasty white-charcoal color.

R22AXKUMNE611K,"It is indeed a nice watch, my boyfriend has gotten complements about it. However, the seconds are not aligned accordingly.

RYZQ7XXCWUMJ5,"I just got the watch. Literally just opened the package. I’m very disappointed in the watch.

I’m a student surgeon in the US. I needed a cheap but reliable watch to keep track of time between patients and other routine metrics. Unfortunately, even in the brightest lit room, the numbering in this watch is so dark that it makes the watch unusable. And in a room that’s only slightly dim, you can’t read the numbering in the watch at all, unless you tap the little button that lights up the watch, but that too is very faint and only lasts for about 1 to 2 seconds before it turns off, leaving you with unreadable digits. I was so excited for this thing. I should have trusted the negative reviews who say the same thing.

If you take a picture of this watch with an iPhone or other smart phones, it will take a picture that presents the digits much brighter than they actually are in person. So I had to turn off the special effects on my iPhone to make sure the picture showed reality, but even the picture I’ve posted here, with my skin lit fairly well, actually shows the numbering in the watch brighter than they really are. In reality they are darker than they appear here, much less readable than they are as shown.

I don’t have time to mess around with Amazon returns. I’m in the hospital for 150 hours per week.",1,30/04/2022,United States
R2AV5FP37XWW8X,When I put this watch on my wrist to a comfortable position (it being tight enough) the end of the watchband stuck out on the side of my wrist (about an inch) and it looked very strange and was uncomfortable.

At least it is working somewhat which is why I updated my review.",3,07/03/2022,United States
RQOMG9LPDOFA8,"Initially I loved the look of the watch. But soon after wearing it, the white band started to get discolored (shown), and I haven't been able to find a way to get it white again. It looks gross. You also have to have the the watch face pointing right at you to be able to read the time well. Again, I like the look of the watch, but the band is terrible quality, and I would not recommend it. Not the white band, anyway. So far it has resisted water well. I have swum with it on a few times with no issues.",3,04/08/2021,United States

Wore it daily and in the shower with no issues. I did develop a terrible sore on my lateral wrist. It was terribly painful and looked bad. I had to stop wearing the watch when it wouldn’t heal.

The next day, I went to the YMCA to swim, and because this watch was 'waterproof', I wore it while I swam. When I got out of the pool, however, I found that the waterproof ring had broken, and there was water vapor accumulation. Disappointed, I threw the watch away and got a new one. Not impressed.

That was my fault but at 3 weeks old I was still surprised. The second time I was in the ocean (no waves) and the pin must have just come loose cuz it suddenly fell off my wrist. I was unable to locate it in the 4-6’ deep water. Over all I love the slick design and simplicity of use but buying a 3rd would have me worried since I originally purchased it for its affordability.

R3TOMUKB433W69,"I got the navy blue watch with the darker screen. The numbers are not bright so you cannot read the time at all unless you click the nightlight button.

It’s also very thick and not breathable. The band is more than half an inch thick and the plastic is heavy. I washed my hands a few times while wearing it and the water stayed underneath the band, had to remove to fully dry hours later. The watch is a bit bulky/clunky overall, so I found it very uncomfortable.

I appreciate that it has many features (including the nightlight) and says the day of the week on the face. Simple and straightforward, but overall not worth it.

Although my favorite part of watch is the faceplate, it tells you the day of the week with letters and numbers, digitally, the appearence is liked. I also like how the watch is reflective to see, when adjusted to sun, to check the time without covering with your hand.

I purchased it because I wanted an inexpensive watch for work to tell time at a glance without fishing my phone out of my pocket every time, and one that I would not be upset about scratching or bumping. For that purpose it works well, and the slim design is a bonus.

However, the pin that holds the wrist band inside the watch body has a nasty habit of popping out if you bend your wrist a certain way, or accidentally bump against something.

I wear a size 10.5 in every other pair of boots, shoes, slippers etc that I own. All the reviews said these shoes fit perfectly. Well that's absolutely incorrect. They fit like they are a size 10, my big toe hits the very end of the toe box, no wiggle room whatsoever. They are also extremely tight on the top of the foot and cut off circulation causing tingling and numbness in my toes within 10 minutes of just wearing them sitting down. The heel cup also doesn't even remotely cup properly, your heel will just slip up and down no matter how tight you sinch the laces. They also aren't as breathable as I thought they would be seeing as they are made of entirely of mesh. These shoes are an absolute joke.

R2OZQR6UC68ZNJ,"Pros:
Stylish Design: The shoes have a sleek and modern design that looks appealing.
Cons:
Poor Traction: The traction on these shoes is severely lacking. I found myself slipping on various surfaces, which was not only frustrating but also potentially dangerous.
Lack of Comfort: These shoes are incredibly uncomfortable to wear for extended periods. The lack of support and cushioning resulted in sore feet and discomfort.
No Arch Support: I also noticed a distinct lack of arch support, which exacerbated the discomfort and made walking in these shoes a painful experience.
Overall Impressions:
I was extremely disappointed with the Bruno Marc Men's Mesh Sneakers Oxfords Lace-Up Lightweight Casual Walking Shoes. Despite their stylish appearance, they fail to deliver on crucial aspects such as traction and comfort. The lack of support and cushioning makes them unsuitable for extended wear, and the poor traction poses a safety risk.
Final Verdict:
I cannot recommend the Bruno Marc Men's Mesh Sneakers Oxfords Lace-Up Lightweight Casual Walking Shoes. Their lack of traction, discomfort, and lack of support make them a poor choice for anyone looking for reliable and comfortable footwear.",1,15/02/2024,United States

RS8C5N5M006DK,"I really liked the look of these shoes, but there's absolutely no heel support in the back of the shoe. What that means is if you're walking any amount of time, you'll struggle to keep your feet in the shoe, and at least for me, that means my feet end up hurting. This is not practical as a daily walking shoe.

I found a much higher quality shoe with a similar look from Johnston & Murphy, that has real support in the back of the shoe. And right now the price is almost the same as this shoe from Bruno Marc.",1,30/04/2023,United States

---------
I purchases these walking shoes for our Japan vacation because of all the walking we're planning. Unfortunately, I had to throw these shoes away 2 days into our trip because the back of the shoe kept scraping my heels. I tried to put a bandaid against my heel but that was only temporary. I eventually just threw them out instead of bringing them back to return to Amazon.

They were comfortable for walking but that issue with scraping my heel just was so uncomfortable. I won't buy these again.

Unfortunately, I couldn't even return these as I didn't want to carry them back in our luggage.",3,07/06/2024,United States
R12BP0L8GW2N69,These look great but are not true to size. I bought the size 13s. These run a half inch narrow. You need to go up a size if you don't have a narrow foot,3,18/12/2024,United States
RJA8NWOYNFW58,"I usually wear a 12 in sneakers, so that's what I ordered. It arrived and felt too long and there was way too much space in the toe box causing my foot to slide around and the shoe to be uncomfortable and to feel like I had no traction walking across my wood floors. So I ordered a pair of size 11, the next size down. Those ended up being way too small and my toes were jammed up against the inside of the shoe and the heel and width were uncomfortable as well. I really need an 11.5 but they don't offer the shoe in that size, so I returned both. It's too bad, because I like the color and the overall design of the shoe. They are lightweight and would otherwise be comfortable, especially for spring / summer in Texas. Too bad they don't fit and don't offer a version that fits me proper.",3,27/02/2024,United States

R36GE21IJXKT5N,"These are great shoes with one exception, the soles. I bought these shoes in January and I really like the style, comfort, and so far the durability. I like them so much I could see myself buying 3 or 4 pair (in different colors) once these wear out. The only thing that will stop me from buying these again is the squeaky sole. They squeak a lot when walking on tile and linoleum, etc... If they fix this issue, they have a returning customer.",3,04/06/2024,United States
R27E09I6M7AQB,"I purchased these shoes almost exactly 1 year ago and have worn them to work (office setting) daily. I wanted to start my review with that comment since it seems like most of the other reviews were written shortly after the shoes were purchased. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't trust reviews from people who have only worn these shoes for a few days. Allow me to give you the real scoop:

These shoes are made CHEAPLY. Nothing wrong with that, but just know they will not hold up like name brand shoes will. There's no such thing as a good deal, you're getting exactly what you're paying for. The soles of these shoes wear down very quickly and the tread becomes smooth and non-existent. This can quickly become a safety issue as the worn down tread makes wet floors feel like an ice skating rink.
Additionally, the fabric behind your heel will quickly wear out and rip (especially if you're slipping the shoes off and on frequently). I found the support to be lackluster and I ended up needing to insert a pair of orthotics.

They're cheap, easy to clean and look decent. However, I will not be buying these again and I'd recommend you avoid them unless you're deliberately looking for a super cheap, low quality shoe. Ignore the 5 star reviews, these are not anywhere near that caliber of shoe.",2,31/03/2024,United States
R2EVC85QOS9KMJ,Since they don’t offer half sizes I had to return. I wear a 10.5 but 11 was way too big and I had to return. Shoes do not come in a box either and were smashed together and kind of messed the form of the shoe up the way they were vacuum sealed in a wrapper. I guess it would straighten out over time and with wearing them.,3,07/08/2024,United States
If you're looking for something to wear for a few months,"I bought the grey - was needing a lite travel shoe for airports and cadual nightlife abroad. These looked great coming out of the box but after a try-on the heel was weak, and the soles very slippery, I can’t imagine on a wet surface or walking airport transfers. Rather than give em a go I decided to return and seek satisfaction elsewhere. YMMV, these just weren’t what I needed.",3,07/06/2024,United States
R1OLDJWA9K7JKG,Overall love these shoes. Comfortable and good looking. But the tongue is either too thin or the lacing is not well designed but after half a day I am getting chafe spots on my foot due to pressure points.

Reviews said to order down a size; I wear a 10 wide so I got a 9.5 standard. I have room in the toe but any smaller and they would have been very uncomfortable around the foot/heel so if you need wides, don't size down more than half a size if wide isn't available.Heel is very shallow, I can feel it pulling down as I walk, might break in over time.

The ankle area of the shoe is sort soft material and sorta wrinkles at the opening and and the laces are at max tightness in order to give me almost a snug fit (also had to wear a sock or they would be to loose). Also feel a slight pronation inward because they are so flat inside and have no arch, I never have problems with probation in other shoes.

They fit like they are a size 10, my big toe hits the very end of the toe box, no wiggle room whatsoever. They are also extremely tight on the top of the foot and cut off circulation causing tingling and numbness in my toes within 10 minutes of just wearing them sitting down. The heel cup also doesn't even remotely cup properly, your heel will just slip up and down no matter how tight you sinch the laces. They also aren't as breathable as I thought they would be seeing as they are made of entirely of mesh. These shoes are an absolute joke. Do not trust the 4 and 5 star reviews because that's what I did and now I'm out of $40. You're better off going to Walmart and getting a cheap pair of shoes there.

R37ID44XUE3NA9,"I usually wear a nine but they were too big. Comfortable though.

The 8 1/2 is still a little big but an 8 would be too small. It would be good enough, but I am returning them.

On the smaller pair, the right shoe has zero arch support. I already have feet problems, don't need more.

Most of the upper looks really nice, what doesn't is that nasty brown leather stripe up the back. So jarring and disgusting.

Just as bad is the side of the sole being white. Not only is white an ugly color and causes shoes to look filthy quickly, it clashes with the look of the upper - minus the nasty brown, which pitches in to ruin the look of the shoe.

There is very little traction. These are slippery on tile or wood floors.

R1VRR84P3OX8S3,"Pros:
Stylish Design: The shoes have a sleek and modern design that looks appealing.
Cons:
Poor Traction: The traction on these shoes is severely lacking. I found myself slipping on various surfaces, which was not only frustrating but also potentially dangerous.
Lack of Comfort: These shoes are incredibly uncomfortable to wear for extended periods. The lack of support and cushioning resulted in sore feet and discomfort.
No Arch Support: I also noticed a distinct lack of arch support, which exacerbated the discomfort and made walking in these shoes a painful experience.
Overall Impressions:
I was extremely disappointed with the Bruno Marc Men's Mesh Sneakers Oxfords Lace-Up Lightweight Casual Walking Shoes. Despite their stylish appearance, they fail to deliver on crucial aspects such as traction and comfort. The lack of support and cushioning makes them unsuitable for extended wear, and the poor traction poses a safety risk.
Final Verdict:
I cannot recommend the Bruno Marc Men's Mesh Sneakers Oxfords Lace-Up Lightweight Casual Walking Shoes. Their lack of traction, discomfort, and lack of support make them a poor choice for anyone looking for reliable and comfortable footwear.",1,15/02/2024,United States

There is also an odd cushion at the base of the inside of the back of the shoe that makes them slip on your heel. If this cushion was placed higher up, it seems like the shoe wouldn't slip.

R1KK05PVXJH0T4,"I have 2 of the long sleeve versions of these in a size small and they fit perfectly, so I ordered a size small in these as well.
