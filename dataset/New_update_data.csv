R107724LM40Q7H,1,"Absolutely disappointed with this product, my mouse didn’t work on it, fit for the bin, on the other hand they did look good",09/12/2024,United Kingdom
R1077APCUBY8XE,1,"The packaging is really impressive, however that’s the high point for me. Squirt a squirt and smell is intense, cloying and all pervasive. It’s most definitely not what I expected, I won’t be buying it again.",02/04/2022,United Kingdom 
R10884UETV1EQT,1,"This machine is very dangerous, it give extremely high readings, it told me my BP was 197/123. As you can imagine I was extremely worried but as I was due to go to work (I work in a hospital) I decided to get one of the nurses I work with to check it and my BP was 129/63. I would not recommend this machine, instead get a properly recognised/calibrated machine or even go to you gp/pharmacy.",11/12/2024,United Kingdom
R10BP1V4VEF4RE,2,"Was comfy on the wrist initially, but quality does not last unfortunately. As you can see in the images, (this pad was only used by 1 adult) it has to be replaced already.",07/07/2024,United Kingdom

R10L39003NSZJL,1,"What a waste of time by Creative.If you're plugging in USB anyway, why bother building a product that can't take data audio from USB. They've probably got 10 or 50p more profit by not including a tiny DAC, but excluded this as a purchase option for anyone seeking actual USB speakers. It's just so strange.",06/06/2020,United Kingdom

R10MTRSE938PN6,2,"Smell is lovely, however it doesn't last very long. I moved it to various size rooms, but yet could only smell it immediately after it's been diffused and during the day you wouldn't smell anything. It's now sitting in a tiny powder room which hopefully will help to enhance the smell.",29/06/2023,United Kingdom

R10VPKUKSKOW1S,1,The mower itself was fine but the plastic peg that pushes into the mower to attach the handle kept coming out. This was after using the mower 4 times on a 40 metre sq lawn. Amazon gave me a full refund but think they should send someone to collect it rather than I have to take it to the post office to send it back,15/07/2024,United Kingdom

R1161C0IUWXAME,2,"This Cazon Electronic Blood Pressure product was left outside my door overnight in the pouring rain, no-one knocked my door. The paper 'envelope' containing, the product was very damp, & the product's shiny cardboard box was not sealed at the bottom & top - so I don't know if it was wet, or if the product was wet & damaged. I have to try the product, as, due to ill health, I need it to check my Blood Pressure asap.  I couldn't tell whether the contents were wet, I can't be sure, but they didn't seem to be damp.The rainwater probably slid off the shiny outer box -it still looks ok. I was going to return the product, but I've changed my mind and am keeping it-I never know when I may need it.This product - the CAZON Electronic Blood Pressure Monitor is quite fiddly to use and I've been rather worried about using it, but it should become more simple after time. I'm going to take it with me to my Doctor, when I next go for an appointment. He sees patients regarding blood pressure and uses his own and  the practice's Blood Pressure Monitors, so he'll be able to show me how to use this one properly.",24/11/2024,United Kingdom
R11FT5E5VM418Y,1,"Read the reviews on these before buying and 8 out of 10 were good with regards to expiry dates and quality, so with all of the outside Christmas decorations I thought I would give them a try - unfortunately the majority of them have had to be replaced within a week and we have gone back to Duracell, which has cost us more than the saving in the end. Really disappointed.",19/12/2023,United Kingdom
R11MJ1BHEFEH8X,1,"AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!!! The device is giving us wrong readings, my wife is pregnant and we need it to be accurate due to preeclampsia. At the hospital and GP we get BP 115-120 and the machine says BP 97!! This is miles off and dangerous as we can monitor her BP! We've done multiple attempts to verify and it’s never accurate!",29/04/2024,United Kingdom

R11OX4I0KWJ2R9,2,"*** NOT QUICK AT ALL***I have given this two stars only because it feels like a good sturdy cable and I can probably still use my phone whilst charging, I have another phone this length that takes 13 hours to charge to full and goes off if I move.I have a ton of shorter cables but they are for phones and charge slow, the samsung lightening cable I have is broken. I was looking to replace this and have something charge my phone quite quickly. It's exactly the same speed as these! No idea where the quick charge of lightening charged comes from but this definitely doesn't do that. At 30% it's saying 6 hours 30 to fully charge. No better than any of the cables I have.If you want a nice sturdy cable that's quite long that you can use when you work etc then fair enough this is great but if you are wanting a quick cable as advertised then this definitely isn't that cable.All in all quite disappointed as Its not how it was advertised and doesn't really do what I needed.",17/03/2025,United Kingdom 
R11PC1Y90A5EHE,3,"Works fine, not the most durable cable but for the money I have no complaints",27/08/2024,United Kingdom

R11QBLKNXDDPE2,2,The cylinder has sunken through the wheelbase and cracked the base. I have only had this since AugustMy chair before this one I had for over 1y and it never happened to that one. (the arms were the issue there) So I don't think this is a 'user' error. Disappointed as it is a comfy chair and the wheels were smooth on the floorboards and loved the colour choices,14/12/2024,United Kingdom
R11QI6XJXAMNOH,3,Machine itself seems good and do manage to get readings but constantly getting error 4 meaning the cuff isn't working properly. Wondering if it's faulty,03/02/2024,United Kingdom
R11T77YQXQE745,2,"I'd just returned from a GP appointment when this arrived. I'd had 2 BP readings this week, both very similar, so expected the same general range of reading from this unit. But this Omron displayed much lower readings, which I knew could not be true. This is because my partner was at the same GP appointment and had blood pressure read, so I tested her and both of our readings were far too low. I tried 3 times, and all 3 readings were wildly different. I've since purchased the Omron X3, which seems of better quality build and has given me consistent accurate readings. It also has the ability for 2 users. I'd recently discovered my blood pressure was creeping up and ordered this unit as I wanted to monitor it as I tried to change my diet. So accuracy is really important. My advice is to buy the X3.",16/10/2021,United Kingdom

R11UIZQG2JADOP,1,"So it was my 25th birthday yesterday and for a present my mum bought me this T H watch but it has turned up with no movement on the watch whatsoever, not sure if there is a certain way to start it but the manual is useless,can you please advise???",23/07/2020,United Kingdom 
R11VVTO12QRMXM,2,Thanks,27/12/2022,United Kingdom 
R11Y5P0RHP9ZVU,3,Arrived 3 days early so that was a good start.Fairly easy for one person to put together though 2 would make it easier. Had a problem locating the screw for the 5th leg into it's nut as  with the leg fully pushed on it wasn't quite in line enough. Had to force the nut through the plastic surround. It took me about 30 minutes and the only tool required was a small hammer to push the plastic screw covers fully on as they were a bit tight.The final product looks good but can't judge longevity as I have only just received it. The only issue I have is that the seat is quite hard compared with my previous chair so I might need to use a cushion.,16/02/2024,United Kingdom
R11YJ48K7QLPD4,1,dont do the job u buy it for,01/11/2024,United Kingdom 
R122JWQAS1S8Q9,2,"It's good, when it works. But after getting error readings 8 times out of 10, I can feel my blood pressure rising.  So if you want to keep your blood pressure low,  maybe don't get this model.",13/03/2025,United Kingdom
R122Y8O1ADS35Z,3,Quite difficult to assemble for elderly people.  This is the 4th flymo we have had its ok but it’s predessor was better,03/05/2023,United Kingdom 
R1234V43P8BW29,2,This blood pressure monitor is pretty standard compared to other ones I have used. Seemed pretty accurate too. The big downside is the cuff is way too small for even average arms.,25/02/2025,United Kingdom
R123C8O082EOCU,1,"Don’t waste your money, bought it, done what it said, turned the switch to the highest setting got 1 puff of mist then nothing, tried it all again, same thing happened, the only way I can get any frangrance is to keep turning it off then on again just to get 1 puff of mist, absolute rubbish.",07/10/2024,United Kingdom 
R126461SVL5YF2,1,Ordered this as I have been recently diagnosed with high blood pressure and this has giving me wrong readings. I came back from being hospitalised and my surprise when the machine shows me low blood pressure and same values for my partner as well. Took it with me to the hospital one of the days I had to go for blood pressure measurements and was way below the hospital machine.It is not accurate at all. Gives a false blood pressure readings specially low ones which is quite severe for those that struggle with blood pressure as they are mislead to think their blood pressure is fine when is actually not.Do not recommend.,24/03/2025,United Kingdom
R126PX68SLFW4J,1,The smallest one is the one I have recently got from the seller the others I’ve got in shops. This is the second one I’ve got from here and both of them seem to only blast out smoke when you first turn them on and then nothing happens after that. All of the others let out smoke on the designated times. I decided to turn them all on at the same time and see if they would all blast out smoke at the same time. the one that I’ve got from Amazon only lets out smoke when it’s first turn on and then does not let any more smoke out. I wasn’t aware so many different designs are out for the exact same product. I don’t recommend this one but I do recommend the other two from elsewhere. at first I thought it was faulty but I have bought a second one to see if this was the case and it turns out this design just doesn’t work.,14/02/2021,United Kingdom 
R12B9BH08JFQLA,1,"The top and bottom had a couple nicks from shipping. Instead of going through the process of sending it back, I used a black Sharpie to color in the spots. It was where a plastic corner shipping piece broke in both spots. The desk is not as sturdy as I hoped but it will do. It is replacing a large desk with drawers. I will see how it holds up. I contemplated getting a Deskhaus frame but didn’t want to spend the money until I give standing desks a try as the frame alone is right at a $1000.",23/02/2025,United States
R12CXLX6Z5CVKT,3,WHY send detergent without a bottle to dispense ? No clear instructions and misleading,22/05/2024,United Kingdom 
R12F4TA2MQA1FP,3,"Amazing product, stays in place, comfortable for my wrist and easy to use for my mouse. I will definitely recommend it! It’s amazing 🤩Problem that has brought down the stars is the delivery, when the delivery driver left my package outside my apartment building than delivering at my door like it was meant to be. Luckily my neighbour saw it outside and delivered it to me by person. Amazon has more lazy delivery drivers now than before. I feel hurt how they deliver people’s packages, people’s money gone to waste",23/09/2022,United Kingdom
R12FTVBYHTI25M,3,"Decent in looks but the seat cushion is cheap quality. The foam is softish and the upholstery on top is okayish. If that was better, it would make this a very good chair.",09/02/2025,United Kingdom
R12G83KIRTSNI1,3,Heavy to use and quite tricky to get the angles right. Cutter works great but must use the strap to use.  Not as flexible as wanted so disappointed overall,12/10/2023,United Kingdom

R12HN24FT5S7OH,1,"I am honest, I am sorry this is how it is; I purchased both of them… it says eu de perfume on them but they are not even eu de toilet they are smelling nice but so quickly disappearing if you know what I mean 😢 they are more likely cologne simple I thought I leave a note so everyone knows how it is like 👍",08/01/2023,United Kingdom 
R12HSZB9USJXNW,2,The top shelf is bowing with less than 20 pounds on it. It looks like it will snap in the future. The motor worked for a few months and then only works sporadically. The turning rod locking bolt loosened and will no longer tighten. The whole thing shakes terribly just when I'm typing. I only paid $170 and it wasn't even worth that. I've only had it five months and it's trash already.,18/12/2023,United States

R12KS0MQXMKMCD,1,Absolute rubbish. Works rarely,29/01/2025,United Kingdom
R12LDYPV28KGXQ,3,"There was no user manual included with this item. We figured out how to use it by reading brief details on the box, but there are other features not mentioned on the box that we want to use.Not sue how accurate this is as each time we take our blood pressure it changes quite a lot, so not sure we can rely on using it. Seems to depend on how tight you put on the arm cuff.",07/02/2024,United Kingdom
R12LZ03L5R2VL6,2,"El producto huele bien, la botella viene con fugas,  no vale la pena su baja calidad de selllado perdiendo líquido y no hay devoluciones.Lo uso para aromatizar el baño ya que no sirve para otra cosa.Muy versátil gran loción para el WC",03/09/2024,United States

R12SV38MVI16OJ,1,Bought a four pack pry bar set. 3 were good. One broke on first use . Poor quality item.,03/02/2024,United Kingdom 
R12VQPB373QUXQ,2,This is a moderate TV. I love that the TV has an app that serves its purpose. But the quality was the problem. It was poor: you couldn’t read the text clearly. The image quality was also poor for my needs. I had to compare this with my other tv and I could tell the difference clearly. I tried to keep it but I knew I wasn’t gonna enjoy the TV so I had to return.,24/08/2024,United Kingdom 
R12VWQHRSJ5M90,1,"Unlike other cables this one doesn’t always carry charge.  You have to plug it in, then wait to see if it lights up before plugging your phone in.  I sometimes have to do this three or four times before it lights up.  Not ideal if you forget this and wake up in the morning with a dead phone.",30/09/2024,United Kingdom

R137ECV0KFWETZ,1,Good but not as per expectations,05/12/2023,United Kingdom 
R137ZOKPT2OKQT,3,"Seems to be reliable for a digital blood pressure monitor . I still use a manual method to accurately take blood pressure readings, as ive never found any digital machine than can accurately do the job as taking it manually. Be that as it may, i have found this machine to be the most accurate at the best price and is good enough for me to have enough confidence in its ability to give constantly accurate enough readings to leave in the bathroom medical cupboard for the rest of the family to use.Very easy, uncomplicated operation. Clear to read display. Seemingly reliable & consistent with its reading  everytime it is usedEasy to clean and change batteries.Everyone should learn how to take a blood pressure manually though and not rely on wholly inaccurate & highly variable machines to do the job.Packs tidily away into a little draw string bag and is small enough to fit in any first aid bag/box/cupboard and is aesthetically pleasantly pleasing in its design though this is not an important quality which is needed.(Edit was a correct typos)",13/09/2024,United Kingdom
R13A3QFDWDCWR7,3,It's OK I guess but doesn't exactly relieve much of the issue of long term use.Probably doesn't help matters that I am left handed and this is clearly designed for righties.The quality of it is also decent but not great.I would have expected slightly more as an 'amazon recommended purchase'.,09/10/2022,United Kingdom
R13CFFLZVA3N2V,2,I’m very disappointed because this charging cable to slow,25/09/2024,United Kingdom 
R13G43BKAZB6D3,2,"The surface is a little bit cheap, it came with a bunch of different holes in it for guiding putting some type of controller on it but it wasn't that hard to figure out where to put the controller that came.If you look at the pictures you can see the desk surface was broken loose from the stand and that is because they use very cheap screws that are very short I had to find wider screws that would not go through the surface and put it back together myself",03/09/2022,United States
R13G55EH9TG5J9,3,"Easy to set up and picture quality is fine.  However, the audio is terrible.  Almost unlistenable.  I had to connect a pair of bluetooth speakers ( which was easy to do ) in order for this to be useable.",05/09/2024,United Kingdom 
R13HHUCIY5888Q,1,"I bought this desk because of health issues related to bad ergonomics. I needed 1) a larger surface area and 2) the ability to adjust it very low (I’m 5’5”). Most adjustable desks in the market cannot go as low as is optimal for my height. This is one of the very few I’ve found that can do that and was relatively inexpensive for a desk this size with moving parts. That said, the desk will often stop while you’re holding the button down and start going in the opposite direction even if it crushes you or whatever is underneath it or pulls wires further than they should go. You have to play with it a bit to get it to work right. Keep in mind it’s also very heavy and difficult to put together for yourself. Despite all of this, it is a very solid desk and great value for the price.",10/12/2024,United States
R13KGARB5G3DBH,3,I like everything about the desk and it was easy to assemble. The desk was covered in gray and rust dust which has stained parts of the desk. Frustrating to not have it packaged in a way to keep it pristine.,23/12/2024,United States
R13O3BBEBVY0PW,1,I’ve had flymo for many years and have always been happy with them. I affectionately called my last one my ‘lady mower’. So thought I would get the smaller more compact one. It’s terrible. It’s a real physical workout to mow a small lawn. I can’t return my mower now as used but will be gifting it on a selling page as soon as possible.,09/06/2024,United Kingdom

R13RU7AAMFYFW1,3,"Weight distribution is all wrong with the heavy motor on the business end. The trimmer is therefore very unwieldy and difficult to balance and manoeuvre. The strap supplied is very mediocre and the shoulder pad is pretty hopeless.Also a shame that the trimmer can only be used with the extension arm meaning the device can't be used as a normal hedge trimmer - you will probable need to buy a standard trimmer in addition to this unit.I might try to add a solid loop handle to the extension pole to see if this helps at all.Overall, pretty disappointing for a Ryobi product.",24/09/2022,United Kingdom

R145ME4R5UHQGV,1,"Assembled this today and the instructions are just bad.1. Product Description should clearly state that you need a screw driver or a drill.2. There is a crossbar that runs from one leg of the table to the other leg. This crossbar comes shortened and you have to loosen the nuts holding it and extend the crossbar.a) They never tell you how far to extend it (you don't know because you don't know the distance between the legs of the table)b) They also don't tell you that after extending it, you shouldn't tighten the screws firmly immediatelyNote: The correct step isi) Pull the right hand side of the crossbar. There 's a small red arrow/text which says 'max'. This means don't extend the right hand side beyond that point.ii) After pulling (extending the crossbar), don't tighten the screws. Keep it just tight enough that the crossbar doesn't fall apart.iii) When you finally lay the table top flat (upside down on the ground), you'll position one leg of the table on the holes on one edge of the flat top. Then you slowly drag the second leg towards the holes on the other edge of the table (since you didn't tighten the screws of the crossbar, the crossbar now slowly gets stretched to the right width/position)3) The table requires 2 screws in the middle. The screws are provided but no holes are pre-drilled. You're expected to drill the holes yourself (I assembled mine without drilling the holes; plan to add them later and then add the screws)4) Someone else mentioned this and I noticed it during the assembly - the table smudges easily. I have the black top and I see smudges any place I place my finger. This is bad.Will update this review after I've used the table",07/01/2024,United States

R14O10VP6FNEOY,2,doesn't feel so strong in your hand and feels like it breaks easily once you drop on the floor. too bulky in comparison to other branded one. not so powerful and the cable near charging head was nearly damaged after just charging for 2nd time. eventually I ended up on buying makita twin kit which has impact and combi both. i wish i had spent this drill's money on some other makita's tool or accessories. I dropped my makita impact for more than 5 times on concrete at my work and still works like brand new. so better save your money and buy any branded one for a bit extra money. even for DIY branded one last you for life.,09/12/2018,United Kingdom

The only positive was the quick shipping. I ordered on 3/7, received the package by 3/9, even started setting it up as soon as it arrived.Immediately opened the package, nothing looked broken or missing. Once the whole desk was put together & plugged in, it was time to do the manual reset as instructed. Held the up and down arrow buttons for a few seconds, then one leg went up a bit, back down and then the other leg did the same thing. After research, that’s not suppose to happen. Tried raising the desk and no luck. After more research, I thought maybe I had put it together incorrectly so I took everything apart, put it back together according to instructions, still no luck. Then again for the 3rd time. Tried contacting the sellers customer service for help, no help. Then the sellers website, which did not have troubleshooting for my model of desk. So then I took the desk apart for the last time and boxed it all back ready to return it. This took me almost 9 hours from putting together for the 1st time to calling it quits and boxing it all back up at 12 am.Since I could not get in contact with the seller, I called Amazon CS. They stated they could message the seller who had 48 hours to respond. The seller answered back next day and wanted me to troubleshoot the same things I did days before. It should not be this hard to return an item if it arrives defective. After days of back & forth messages the seller was absolutely no help. Went back to Amazon & filed the A-to-Z guarantee. This guarantees that since the desk came broken I could send it back and receive the refund. *Disclaimer- if you try to return the item, the seller doesn’t cover shipping, that’s on you.Followed the Amazon Claims instructions and went to the post office & spent $96 to ship the package. If you have to do this, make sure to have someone sign at delivery once the package is received for your records. Also, keep the post office receipt and upload to your Amazon claim page in the app.The package delivered a few days later, Amazon stated to wait 72 hours to receive the refund back from the seller. 72 hours went by and no refund. Contacted Amazon again w/ the evidence from the USPS website showing the package was delivered. Amazon immediately issued a refund. Then, also refunded the shipping costs. So kudos to Amazon for being so helpful!I purely bought this desk because 1)it was affordable and 2) it looked of good quality. So some advice, please look at ALL of the reviews, good and bad so you don’t have to go through the headache of what I had to go through & don’t buy an item just solely based on the low price. Definitely do your research! Hope this helps the next person!",04/04/2025,United States

I'm tempted to set up a trail cam in my shed to see if it's haunted.After one season the mower started to cut out intermittently.

R164U5MO60PGZM,2,"In an effort to be more environmental and to save my back, I bought the Greenworks battery operated mower. Firstly the battery lasts approx 20 to 30 mins.  As it powers down from about 15 minutes into the operation the mower becomes more erratic.  It does not have the power to throw the cut grass into the grass bin and so keeps stopping and you have to lift the lid to push the grass back by hand.  It leaves clods of grass on the lawn and this then needs to be raked but still remains an untidy finish.  Of the 5 cutting levels, the lowest churns up the lawn and the next up is too low for the battery strength although I get round this by doing a first cut on the middle height followed by the next one down. This uses both batteries so its just as well that two batteries are supplied and that they recharge fairly quick.",02/08/2021,United Kingdom

R16TBBOAZXWS54,3,"First words that comes to mind regarding the materials and quality: cheap, average, lacklusterI ordered the 55” x 28” version of this item that includes a white frame + maple particle board top (btw, I thought I had ordered the bamboo top but hence got the cheaper particle board mess). The actual model is E4W (not the E7, as I expected). This was marketed as being heavily discounted during the most recent Prime day in 2023.The only capability I can see with this is an anti-collision feature which prevents the desk from crushing whatever is beneath the table (if lowering), or pressing up against (if raising).Pros:+ ease of assembly+ frame and top ship separately,+ packaging is good, keeps things protected,+ table has rounded corners,+ good stability when raised to ~48”,+ good range that can go below 25”,+ electric motors operation is smooth and quiet,Cons:- no cable tray management for wires underneath,- frame to top mounts uses self tapping screws (basically when used with particle board, it’s a one time drill in)- pre drilled holes aren’t the best alignment: expect to drill holes yourself where the prescribed ones should have worked (I had to finesse the frame mount alignment to pre drilled holes, they were off by 1/8”)- marketing makes you think you’re getting a E7, but in reality it’s just a lower tier E4- cheap ac/dc adapter (think a small laptop) with limited length of wiring to the brain- cheap metal holder for the ac/dc adapter- questionable if this holds up to intended weight and load rating based on the quality of parts (item description says it’s rated at up to 287 lbs total; but the framendocumentation says it’s 220 lbs)For a “pro” level desk; it does not come with any cable management tray as seen as with other desks. Don’t be fooled by the marketing. Actually, this is a basic desk with minimal features. All in all, IMO this desk is not worth anything over $200, It would have been better off getting a used Haworth or commercial desk (found in the workplace).",10/08/2023,United States

R173K6NPQL9HAH,2,"I brought this set of charging leads specifically because it mentions and shows pictures of their “Bionic Tail Joint” that “Never Breaks”, giving a 45,000+ bend lifespan. These images clearly show the joint flexing and so protecting the cable. Yet on receipt of the product it is clear this is absolute rubbish as the joint/glands are so stiff that they have no give in them whatsoever. This will result in the cables simply breaking where they enter the gland like any other cable.It is a shame as the connectors seem of reasonable quality and the braided cable seems better quality than many others I have bought, but this is let down by what I mentioned above.Time will tell how long they last and I will update my review as and when I have more news to report.UPDATE: Sunday 10th July 2022.On 4th July I received an email from the supplier asking for my address saying they “would like to send you a upgraded version for another try”, and during the week a pack of 2 x 2m cables turned up. Whether they are better than the originals sent remains to be seen, as in all honesty the “Bionic Tail Joints” of the 2 replacement cables sent don’t seem a great deal more flexible than the originals.Today they’ve emailed me again asking if I had received the replacements, also asking me to change my review. However, I ordered a box of 5 so sending only 2 possibly better cables doesn’t really cut it as far as I am concerned. I’ve replied to that email explaining honestly that sending 2 supposedly better cables does not warrant changing my review, but that I would add an update…which I have now done.",19/06/2022,United Kingdom

I went through the troubleshooting and nothing worked as I couldnt pinpoint where the problem was - whether it was a faulty remote or firestick. I borrowed a remote from a friend and it worked straight away thereby identifying the error.The remote came supplied with suppliers batteries. Replacing the batteries did not help either as the blue led indicator light did not illuminate. I tried adding the remote from the ""add new remote"" screen but was unsuccessful. I swapped batteries between the remotes to see if the batteries were the issue but that also failed.The best thing I can say about the firestick is that you can use the firestick app instead of the remote which is a bonus, otherwise I would have had to pay an extra £22 just for a firestick remote - the app is useless if you cant get past the initial set up screen to add the remote and set up the wifi connection.This is not the standard I was expecting.Wil update when required.",18/07/2024,United Kingdom
R17AYC3VG0G84R,3,"Well I had to calm myself down for three hours before writing my review. Otherwise it would have been full of bad language, rage and bile and that would have not been fair on anyone. Ok here I go. I brought this machine as my other one, not a Karcher, was starting to die on me after many years of service. I decided, after everyone kept on telling me how amazing Karcher was and how fantastic they were. So I took the plunge. Putting it together was ok, except for clicking in the hoses, but it was all put together in about ten minutes. Then we come to using it! As a powerful jet washer, it did the job. My grief I had while using it was it constantly fell over with a crash, with just the slightest movement of the hose. The hose itself was always trying to form a coil and tangle itself, again making the machine fall over. The constant worrying about the bloody thing, sorry, falling over, made the whole job of cleaning the car a miserable experience. It should be a happy event when you car is nice an shiny, not a thank fudge that's done labour. Stowing the hoses leads and lances on the machine, again caused it to fall over. Even standing in the garage now all is done, I've gone to check on it like it's a nervous new pet! If I getup tomorrow and it's fallen over, I will not be surprised. So I must say on power and cleaning, of a car, it did well, but did I enjoy using it, no. Maybe when it's been used a few times and the hoses loose some of their stiffness it will be better, but I still think the whole unsalability of the unit will be there. It was a good price. It was delivered on time and undamaged. Sorry for rambling on, but wanted to be fair. x",10/05/2023,United Kingdom

I have been using it semi regularly since I bought it in October but now about 7 months later the power cable has decided to stop working so I have to use batteries. On the one hand it's good that there is option to power it with batteries, however, now it's going to increase the cost of using it due to the added cost of having to buy batteries. This is the only reason I've given 3 stars. If I could continue using it without having to buy batteries I would give 4.5 stars. The last 0.5 star is taken off due to the provided cable being too short, if it was longer I'd give 5 stars. Overall a very good BP machine to use at home if you need to monitor your BP.

R17U4TLCWIXA12,2,"I’ve had this height adjustable desk for about seven months now, and unfortunately, what started out as a promising product has turned into a frustrating daily experience.At first, it seemed fine. The height adjustment was smooth, and I was excited about finally having a standing desk. But after just a few months, I began to notice some wobbling whenever I adjusted the height. Fast forward to now — it's significantly worse. The desk shakes noticeably during adjustments and even while typing or leaning slightly on it. It’s gone from a minor annoyance to a full-on distraction.Stability should be a top priority in a desk like this, especially one meant for ergonomic use and long hours. Instead, it feels like the internal mechanism or frame has gradually weakened over time. I haven’t overloaded it, and it’s only been used for basic home office tasks (monitor, laptop, keyboard), so I can’t chalk it up to heavy use either.For the price, I expected much better durability and build quality. I now find myself reluctant to adjust the height at all, which completely defeats the purpose of having a sit-stand desk in the first place.Pros:Easy to assembleInitially smooth height transitionsCons:Becomes unstable over timeShakes during use and adjustmentPoor long-term build qualityWould not recommend if you’re looking for something sturdy and reliable.

I managed to put it up again, but it was very rickety. Today, in January 2025, I used the button to move the desk up and one side went down really fast and made a crunching noise. After I tried to move it again, it made more crunching noises and then stopped moving entirely, giving me an error message.

I initially assembled it and set it up and it work for a couple of weeks (saying that I didn’t have a need to adjust the height after the initial adjustment so essentially it worked once). I bought a new chair and tried to adjust it but nothing worked. I reset it and it automatically started descending and stopped when I pressed the button. It wouldn’t rise or descend after resetting. Support was reasonable but nothing they asked me to do worked. They are supposed to be shipping a new motor but I have little confidence now in this piece of kit and wished I had of just bought one from Ikea.,02/01/2025,United Kingdom

R18MFDJKRFMY2Y,3,"I had heard good things about this standing desk in a handful of forums as well as reviews on amazon, so I decided to give it a shot.The positives I can give about this desk is that it was delivered promptly and it appears to be sturdy.  However, that’s where the positives end.Upon opening the box some pieces had some scuff marks and scratches. I don’t think this was a pre-used item, I think this may have come from the factory, which is not great quality control.Some of the instructions were ambiguous for a number of reasons. One being that the images some times didn’t have the correct orientation and when there was a close up shot, it covered the position of where the item should go.  In addition, some items were labeled incorrectly (e.g. there were two different screws in two different steps labeled “B”) or there were items that were labeled (e.g. 9 & 14) but there is no 9 or 14. Even if there were, why switch from letters to numbers?Also, some words used in the instructions were not grammatically correct, which makes me believe that the instructions were created by coping and pasting into a translator app.   Of course, you can use context clues to figure out the situation, but you should not need to.The instructions also had instructions for screwing in items in places that had no holes in them, which is confusing and again not a good look for quality control.Upon completing the build, it appears to be sturdy but the motor that drives the riser is a bit slow compared to other standing desks I have used. It just feels like it’s rather weak and on its final legs in comparison.  So in short, it works but my only question is for how long. This ambiguity and quality control issues makes it hard to recommend to others.",28/12/2024,United States

R193GGLX13HBI2,3,"To be fair, I don't usually buy this kind of speaker. I find that small drivers voiced to put out more bass than they can actually manage, can end up sounding quite ridiculous. I've tried a few cheap speakers and they never work out well, so I wasn't expecting much. I expect vocal clarity and intelligibility to be the first goal of any speaker designer, and these don't do that. They are muffled and boxy, with a very high emphasis on bass output.As you can see for the video, the enclosure is so light that it starts rotating when the bass hits, so even that didn't work out well.  This is connected to a pro interface with +4dBu output, hence there's no capping of the bass transient. No EQ was used. With onboard sound or a USB DAC I'm unable to reach this level. The speaker is fed from a 5V, 3A power supply - using a motherboard's USB-C sees distortion set in a lot earlier. I measured the usable output level at 80dB at 2 feet for music, maybe a bit higher for compressed modern pop music and then a little more for internet video. You'd just be able to get 85-88dB max if you're sitting close up.When using the USB-C of the motherboard (and, I'm assuming, a USB-C PD charger), there's no apparent way to shift the speaker to low gain mode. When using the external supply the difference between the modes is quite apparent. The High mode sacrifices some more of the already poor fidelity, making the treble more peaky and the enclosure rotates a little earlier.The wires are extremely short. I can barely get it on either side of a 30"" monitor and have to get creative (no pun intended) to get the right placement. I needed a basic speaker to cover one PC's audio output till the pandemic situation ended, and needed something a little better than the R12U I was using earlier. This is fine for that.This is my fourth cheap Chinese product, and they are all terrible. The sound processing employed by all of them ruins the sound and if you never heard a good speaker you'd think it is okay, but it's not. Creative tried to get a tiny 1.5"" driver (it's not 2"") to sound big and it just ends up confused. You can just about make out the vocal section, and the bass is boxy and just sounds cheap.One caveat though, when running speech and Youtube videos off cheap motherboard audio it sounds acceptable. It's only when connected to a proper source and playing music with proper transients, that you can tell it's junk. For my intended application it'll work, but don't be misled by the positive feedback. You are never going to get more than you are paying for it.",13/12/2023,India

This extra 15cm still won't help anyone with even a relatively short 1.4m desk. The speaker-to-speaker cable is also fixed at both ends, meaning you can't integrate it into many cable management systems or extend it. The power and audio jack cables are also very short at 1.2m but at least they can be extended via other cables (sold separately).The speakers look nice enough and have helped to de-clutter my desk, replacing my old Creative GigaWorks T20 behemoths. Sound is fine for someone like me who mostly uses headphones and just wants something functional for the rare occasion where I have to play something out loud.Line in and headphone out sockets would be nice but I appreciate it's not a key feature for such cheap, small speakers.

R1DZ82OQ5DLQ1E,1,I bought this machine based on the Karcher name Believing that Karcher products are robust and fit for use! It was by no means a cheap option for me.The quality of the body of machine is made.of very thin cheap plastic The area where the handle slips into has no clips or way of securing the handle. So could easily slide out while carrying the machine and I suspect one fall could very easily crack the body of the machine. Also I've not been able to use the machine be cause karcher do not include the proper hose fittings so now I have to hunt down the fittings! I'm very disappointed not only with karcher but amazon too..the instructions with the machine expressly state NEver to use hose coupling with Aquastop on the water connection of the device! Page 7 on instruction leaflet....yet they sell this very Aquastop under the Karcher name on Amazon! I noted this from another reviewer the connector itself had literally fallen. To bits. He provided pictures of thw nightmare connector..I do not have high hopes for this machine and do not want anyone else to pay good money for a device which begins to disappoint once everything is unboxed.

R1GA8N6PAFU8AX,2,"The overall three stars: After receiving and very carefully putting the desk together using padding at all point, I noticed dents in the desktop, as well as a chip on a corner. The dents are square- or star-shaped, like a Phillips screwdriver was tapped onto the surface, and the chip is a decently big one that I didn't create. At this price point, and for the size of the packing materials (that of course I threw away before I saw the flaws the next day in sunlight), I expect better when the product is new. Let me ding it up myself, down the line....As for the rest, I wanted to leave a review specifically for people who are smaller and not as strong, because receiving and putting together your own furniture can be quite a task.Box: The box is a big one; you'll likely need to turn it sideways--that is, not along its widest edge--to get it through an average door. Keep this in mind if you're using a dolly. At over 80 pounds, you can probably slide the box along the floor on its own over carpet, or with a towel over tile or similar. There are no extra straps to grasp, which I generally take as a good thing, but getting the box up stairs could be an issue, unless you do a wrap and drag thing with a blanket and have the strength. Of course, it's always an option to open the box and take pieces upstairs individually, but the individual pieces are heavy and apparently pretty fragile, so I'd recommend NOT unboxing before you're ready to build, if you can. The box itself is two pieces, so that's a help; once you cut through the small amount of tape, you're in. There's somewhat unfortunately not a lot of protective styrofoam inside--not a phrase I'm used to saying, but I think that would have helped here.Assembly: The two biggest pieces are inside large plastic sacks, so you can use these to slide out the desktop and the legs. Watch out for the drawer to open. I moved a piece of tape on the bottom on the desk over to hold this closed. The desktop is the heaviest piece, so have a blanket or towels ready to go, both to protect the desk and your floor and to help you turn over the desk later. Next, the legs are all one piece, and--best part--they fit upright, or upside down, against the upside-down desktop in such a way that you don't have to hold them in place or put the whole thing in a corner for support while you screw in a couple of bolts (the wrench is included--no need for your own tools). Then, the two feet get attached; if you're adding anything like a felt pad or swapping out for the casters, do that before you attach the feet to the desk. There are a couple of things to plug in, and you'll see that in the instructions. I recommend doing that while it's all still upside-down. That's it! It's pretty quick. For strength and strain, moving the box, pulling out the desktop, pulling out the legs piece, and turning the whole thing over once assembled are all of the big lifts. The last will be easiest if you don't use the separately purchased casters, but I found them strong enough to make it over the turn, with a little lifting.Features: I was most interested in the drawer, which I didn't see on other standing desks, as that keeps clutter out of sight. It could be bigger, but I won't knock it, in that beggars can't be choosers way. Having the USB ports on the corner is great for charging devices, and I haven't had any problems raising or lowering the desk, and with the added casters (on a hard-surface floor), I can quickly turn from looking out the window to where I have a meetings-friendly backdrop, move the desk for cleaning, etc. I added a hanging cord organization basket, as this doesn't have one of its own, and...well, it could, as could most desks. I'll probably add a headphones hook at some point, and I'd love to have some adjustable, floor-level but movable basket for a desktop computer, though mine is light and the desk doesn't seem to have any issues with it, a monitor, and other computers, speakers, and a lamp. I haven't tried out the presets yet, but it's good to know that with one touch, I can adjust the height to one I've already tried and found ergonomic.",05/07/2022,United States

R1GJNQFQN2E8Z6,3,"I don't want to be overly harsh as it's in the cheap price range but I feel picking this mower wasn't my finest moment. It arrived quickly and despite other reviews it went together easily. It folds back down nicely to fit in a small car. The cuttings box has decent cubic volume as is easy to remove and reattach. Blade cutting width is good for a cheap electric mower and the depth lever is in an OK place to use. So far so good. However when using the depth control its hard to know what depth you've chosen. The wheels are a very cheap setup and there is far to much play on them which does make straight lines tricky. Unlike cheap qualcast mowers (that also have no rollers) this mower doesn't leave stripes. All in all there's nothing wrong with this mower, I've just had better for similar money",29/12/2021,United Kingdom

R1H242OSKBSDPL,1,"So I've actually bought one of these cables before, and I liked it so much I got a three pack. Now due to my own lack of diligence I believed it was a three pack of the same length, when it was a mixture of lengths. But that's my fault, I don't fault them for it, it is clearly explained if you look.Seeing as I didn't need a short cable I gave it away to someone as soon as I realised it was short. That's going to be an issue shortly. So I went to use the cable for the first time today and when I plugged it in I noticed the light on it was much dimmer than the light on on my existing older cable. Like, so dull it's hard to notice. I plugged my phone in and it gained 1% over the span of 40 mins, on standby on my desk.So obviously the cable is defective, and you may say, well just return it and get a replacement. But I can't do that because I gave one of the cables away. In the end it doesn't function as expected, it doesn't handshake fast charging, and it's so slow it's basically useless.Frustrated is not the word. (To be clear, my first cable was good, good enough to make me buy another set. But just make sure you check all the cables work as expected before giving one away.)",11/09/2024,United Kingdom

R1H9XRP0UC3EH6,1,I bought this almost a year ago but have only just started to use as was asked by surgery to record blood pressure twice a day for a week due to having high blood lressure. Sometimes it gives a reading of 102/60:or similar and then 5 minutes later 140/62 but reading taken by nurse (at my home using her monitor) was 161/75. When this is used on myself it doesn’t usually pump up to more than 140 before counting down. I don’t feel I can trust it to be a true indication of what my BP really is.

We bought this desk on Amazon based on its reviews, but as I said at the beginning, cheap ends up expensive!The desk is very nice, the size is great, and it's easy to assemble. However, the seller and customer service aren't very efficient. They’re friendly but not efficient.The mechanism that raises the desk doesn’t work, so I contacted the seller and told them that I was happy to keep the desk but asked them to send me a replacement for the damaged item. Videos, photos, emails, more videos, more photos, more emails… and five days later, despite all the evidence I've sent, they still haven't agreed to send the replacement. On top of that, they respond to emails in the middle of the night (UK time), and when I reply in the morning, I don't get a response until 3 or 4 a.m. the next day. It's frustrating.Since I got tired of all the back-and-forth emails, I decided to proceed with the return. Guess what? I have to pay for the shipping costs! And I’m not returning a 2 kg package but probably something weighing 10 kg or more. This makes me wonder, is it even worth returning it? How much am I going to have to pay?

Again, as a spare monitor for work that's not an issue. But it feels cheap.When I turned it on, there was some discolouration on the left hand side and when I looked at it, the left hand side of the screen is curved whilst the right hand side is straight. Can't tell if it's a manufacturing fault or the way it's been handled to get to me. But it means the screen is warped.Tried to turn it off with the remote, and the light flickers indicating a signal but the TV stays on. All other remote functions appear to work. A quick Google indicates that this might be a common issue.All in all it's a cheap TV that'll be used for work only, but if I'd bought it for use as an actual TV I'd be asking for my money back and paying the extra for a better made one.Updated review after 6 weeks. TV randomly switches from HDMI1 to HDMI2, even if only one has a cable in.

I paid £59.99 in total. In the past, at the very start when Amazon first released the Fire Stick, I used it for a very short period of time. However, this time, I wanted to use IPTV on my LG home TV. Since it was not possible to install OTT TV on the LG TV, I started to research how I can start using the application. Later, I was veryupset to learn that the Firsetick cannot be used for this specific IPTV app, and I left it. As a result, the firestick is useless to me. It is a good device, however, I do not need it for waht is has to offer. Earlier, today, I found out that I can send the purchase back to Amazon and get a full refund. But I just found out that I as eligle for a refund only for a month from the day of buying it.

R1N8YEESQVFNWJ,2,"I'm not one to usually leave a review, but I bought this as I moved to a new house. I was really excited as I've been wanting a standing desk for a while, but obviously with moving and xmas I had to go for a more budget option. The size is good! It looks great, I won't lie. However I found that there are quite a few problemsOne The actual functionality of it. I've not used it as often as I'd've liked as I have gotten an office job. However the buttons don't tend to work. I set the two heights I would like and it just will not move most the time. Sometimes it will work if I unplug it and replug it, but for the most part it remains stationary at the one height. If I press the two buttons to reset it to factory mode it will go down, but I cannot get it to standing height! Additionally the motor is VERY loud, and quite annoying.Finally despite the wood looking good, and the size being nice, I wouldn't say it's the most stable. I can see everything shaking when the height changes (if I can even get it to change at all)All and all I would probably recommend possibly getting a different model, as I've only had this desk about 3 months, and have scarcely used it for it to be this dysfunctional (If I used it constantly maybe I'd understand the lag a bit better but again, I've not used it nearly as much as I would have liked to)",01/04/2025,United Kingdom

The armrests, though flip-up, feel flimsy and don’t stay in place when I try to adjust them, which is frustrating.I wish I had spent a little more on a higher-quality chair. The Naspaluro Office Desk Chair does the job in terms of being functional, but it doesn’t live up to its ergonomic promises or the comfort I expected.

Based on the description, I thought the data transfer speed would be sufficient for my Xbox controller, but it simply won't detect it and instead just charges it.Next, I tested the cable with my phone for data transfer, and the data transfer speed was extremely slow—it would take ages to transfer anything. Initially, I thought the cable might be faulty, so I ordered another one and encountered the same result. It did not work for data transfer and wouldn't function with my Xbox controller at all.On the positive side, the cable quality is good, and the charging speed support is satisfactory. If you have no issue with data transfer, then this cable is a decent choice for charging your devices with high-speed chargers. However, if you need a cable for data transfer, I would not recommend this product due to its slow data transfer speed and incompatibility with my Xbox controller.",18/02/2025,United Kingdom

This IS mentioned in the product spec but it should also be made clear in the product title/description but it is not.These cables charge my phone at exactly the same speed as my old USB 2.0 cables that I bought a year or two ago so there is no benefit there either.The build quality seems reasonable but I'm a bit miffed because I thought I'd paid for USB 3.1 cables. Don't be fooled by the description. Read the smallprint and shop around if you need faster data transfer.,19/12/2023,United Kingdom

It's 2 pieces  that you have to join with wooden dowel pins and brackets.. you are left with an unnecessary groove where dirt and things gather. Not shown in the product drawing clearly either!3) Edge is not rounded with a proper radius to avoid it from digging in to the under side of your forearm if you're sitting slightly lower to be able to look straight at your laptop screen. In a few mins you feel the edge biting you. Why not make a larger radius all the way around??4) Thin guage metal brackets provided for the drawer and battery holder are so flimsy, if you bend it the wrong way by mistake and then bend it the right way.. you have ruined your bracket for good! Why not stamp these brackets to shape without the perforations that make them so weak?This product could be so much better!

R1V2L9IVC9TFUH,3,"For the price I expected better finish on the desktop. My other bamboo standing desk, that my wife now uses, was $150 cheaper than this one. This is the one I will  be comparing it to. It had a much nicer finish to the desk top section.I bought this because of how low it goes. It is replacing another sanding desk.  Range height is great. Raising it is smooth and sturdy. My desk has the curve in it.Assembly isn't to bad, just get it as square as possible at the start. However,  I had to do a little drilling since the center rail bracket holes, didn't have any holes. Also had to drill holes for the power pack. The instructions do not tell you to drill holes, but I wouldn't put a screw in wood without drilling a pilot hole.What I really don't like is the beveled edge of the desk is sharper than is should be in some areas. Very inconsistent edge around the table top. I'm going to have to take some high grit sandpaper to knock the edge off. Bad thing is that it's right in the curve where I sit. Hoping I can take the edge off without damaging the overall finish.Next is the cable management holes. Those are even sharper edge with no bevel at all. I didn't realize this desk didn't come with covers for those holes. Guess I'll need to buy them. My cheaper desk came with covers.  Again for the price, they couldn't toss them in.Next thing I don't like is that table top finish, very grainy feeling. The coating on it isn't enough to make it feel flat/smooth. My cheaper desk, also has bamboo top but has a nice smooth finish. This doesn't impact functionality of desk or even writing on paper. It's just not a nice finish, kind of makes if feel gritty/dirty.  I might get a desk mat.Just expected better finishes for the price, given my past experiences.",11/04/2022,United States

R1VLWSQHBCI1P,3,"I work from a home office and needed a new chair as my old one was creaking, but I was hesitant as it was still comfortable and well padded. I chose this item because a number of reviews mentioned how comfortable it was over long periods, however I don't agree with this. I'm of average build, 6ft tall, and have no issues with the seat adjustment and height. The problem is the seat padding is not as lush as the product description would lead you to believe - you can definitely feel the base of the chair through the seat cushion, and after a relatively short while, it's uncomfortable.The other, minor complaint is that when fixing the base mechanism, the holes are too small for the supplied washers and it's impossible to fix as the install guide suggests. Leaving them out doesn't seem to be an issue, so it's a minor point.Overall, I will be looking to change it for something more suitable and wouldn't consider it again for an office chair.",18/03/2025,United Kingdom

However the new lead worked well on the original charger so I suppose I was lucky.  The lawn mower does not like tufty bits so run over those on a high number first.  It doesn't like bumpy lawns.

But what about  maneuverability?….well the hose is medium length but you won’t even be able to get around to the other side of your car to clean it without constantly having to lug the whole unit as it only has two wheels on it.

R22LX6N6X3MVT4,3,"The desk has some significant design issues. Since the desktop is split into two pieces that you need to assemble, it doesn’t line up perfectly. You can clearly see that one side is slightly crooked, and the two parts don’t sit flush together. It just doesn’t look right.Now, if you’re like me and decided to ignore the reviews, and you encounter the issue where the desk won’t move up or down, here’s how I fixed it: 1. Unplug the desk from the power outlet and wait about 10 to 20 seconds. 2. Plug it back in. 3. Hold the up (^) and down (v) buttons simultaneously for about 5 to 10 seconds. The desk should move slightly up and down on its own, which means it’s resetting. 4. After the reset, press the up button (^) to raise the desk fully. 5. Then press the down button (v) to lower it completely.After that, it worked fine for me, but here’s the thing—there are a few more issues. First, mine came missing a crucial piece. The steel connectors that hold the two parts of the desktop together? You’re supposed to get three, but I only got two. So I ended up using one on each side, but there’s no connector in the middle, which probably adds to the alignment issue.You’ll also want to have a magnetic star screwdriver on hand. Most of the screws are set deep into the pieces, and without a magnetic tool, the screws keep falling inside and it’s frustrating to get them out. All they provide in the box is an Allen key, which doesn’t help for most of the screws.Lastly, the assembly instructions could definitely be improved. At one point, you’re asked to screw something in, then later, you’re asked to unscrew and screw it again—it feels unnecessary and poorly thought out.In summary, the desk works after a bit of troubleshooting, but I wouldn’t recommend it due to the poor design and missing parts.",25/10/2024,United Kingdom

R23JW9F1XBE0J4,2,"These GP Ultra AAA batteries aren't cheap because the manufacturers are feeling generous.  They're not cheap because Santa has come early either.  They're not even cheap because you've probably never heard of them before.No.  They're cheap because they don't last long.  We have used them in battery powered internal Christmas lights.  However, we're also running an identical set of lights off another brand of AAA batteries.  The GP Ultra had gone within 48 hours.  The other brand (begins with E and has lots of Energy!) is still powering the lights 3 days later.  So you're getting 40% of the performance of a major brand at a price that isn't 40% less.  That's based on the major brand lights dying today too - which they don't show any signs of doing.  I suspect the 40% is going to be more like 20%.I'm afraid I'll not be purchasing them again.  I'll buy a pack of other batteries from a major brand, undoubtedly with fewer batteries in it, that'll last a hell of a lot longer.If you still go ahead and buy them, don't come onto Amazon and say ""I should have known"".

R23U9968FEY2TW,2,"I'm 6'3"" and weight about 100kg. Chair states it is strong enough for up to 110KG. Absolutely not true. It isn't comfortable enough for my size and it does not feel structurally strong. I tightened to the max the screw that prevents the leaning back as I dislike it and it just died on me on the 3rd day of use. Arm rests are too low if you have a long chest like I do too. It may be okay for smaller, lighter users like women and teenagers, but definitely not good enough for a bigger users like myself. I don't expect it to last long. Probably should've invested in a bigger, better chair. We'll see how it goes but so far very disappointed...",20/07/2024,United Kingdom

R2413L6RWJ2NXF,1,"The assembly was fairly straightforward but could use improvement. Probably quite difficult if you were to assemble by yourself. There were 2 screws you need to undo to take apart a couple pieces that were screwed together for shipping. This part was not in the setup instructions so I was confused for a bit on how to move forward.Overall it's a pretty sturdy desk, looks nice and has enough room for 3 monitor and a small laptop.I have a few gripes about this though that are a bit of a dealbreaker:1. The motor or axles squeak when the table goes up and down. I don't think it's something that goes away from ""breaking in"" either. It just sounds like it needs lubrication or something (I'm not an engineer so I can't say for sure).2. I wish it was faster. It takes about 30 seconds to go lowest to highest setting. moving it up and down is also a bit finicky. Pressing and holding the button will move it slightly, and then stop for about a second, and then start moving again. If you let go, it will keep moving. So there is no option to just hold the raise/lower buttons and then let go when you're ready.3. The frame is very close to the edge of the desk. This causes a couple problems: A) My monitor arm's clamp doesn't sit flush to the table because the table frame blocks it from going further. Not too big an issue since the monitor arm still feels quite stable. B) Keyboard trays barely clear the frame. I have a Logitech MX mouse that hits the frame when pushing the tray in, so the mouse will just fall to the ground. Any keyboards that are propped up at the back will probably not clear either.Unfortunately this isn't a product that you can just test out and then return, so I'll have to figure something out around the keyboard tray.",18/03/2024,United States

R24GWQ8QA33YC6,2,"I've had two previous Karcher that have broken, the first stopped working and the second's motor disintegrated on its third use, unfortunately, it was out of warranty, typical. the reason I brought this Karcher K2 was it was cheap, the problem with this model is it has a different connection method, the hose is thinner and of cheap plastic, after I brought it I found my extension hose could not be used because on the new type of connector, I think the reason for the new connector was that the old screw on the connector would sometimes come off if now screwed on tightly and there was a problem with the plastic threads which easily broke off leaving no way to use it.

I placed another order for Bamboo one where the description says the height is 50' but its not- the max height for that table is 48' and its not a EC5 , its E4 which is cheaper than E5. I had to talk to 10-15 associates from Flexispot - where each one of them gave me different options with false promises. At last I received a table frame and no table top at all. I spent 900$ (which will be returned) but wasted 7-10 days (30-40 min every day) talking to Amazon as well as Flexispot associates and they still couldn't help.

I was able to tune them all in, but only after having to add several transponders manually. This I could live with, but once tuned, I then found it was very tedious to sort the channels, took about an hour.Again I can live with this but then I found it doesn't keep the order I set. After watching for a while, when I went to change channels the order had changed. I tried resorting them again but the order was changing randomly even as I was trying to sort them. I then found it will randomly reorder the channels every time its turned on. Sometimes the order changes while your watching, go to change channels and they are in a different order. This is very frustrating when you have 150 channels. Funnily there is no such issue with the DVB-T channels, which have kept the order I set.If you are looking for a TV with a satellite tuner, choose a different one.",03/08/2024,United Kingdom

As it doesn't contain the grass it chuck it all over my decking and pond so now it's a massive clean up operation after using it.It's quite loud for a small machine as well, I was very disappointed in the cutting width,to me it's too small another inch would be much more useful.The basket doesn't really collect much grass for my liking and changing the blade is not a safe operation as you need to grasp the bit that spins around to get the spanner on the bolt to unlock it, but if your hand slipped you will slice your hand open.Overall I am dissatisfied and disappointed with this product and will probably be sending it back as it's not what I was expecting in performance or safety.The only good thing I can really say is that it's lightweight.Otherwise it's poor value for money.",12/08/2024,United Kingdom

R28PEPJLRTNF8Y,2,"I cannot comment on the product function itself as it had not been used however, I would say that of you are looking for a mains powered blood pressure machine this is slightly misleading.The reason being it's that 1. It has a USB cable- like the ones used to charge phones2. The cable is very short so depending on where you plug in the product it will be hard to use, especially for elderly. Also, only the cable is included ,not the head of the charger you need to plug into the socket.",14/11/2024,United Kingdom

""Handed to resident"" was the delivery report, in reality the package was left at the exposed side door of my house in the pouring rain. We were at home, but the courier didn't ring or knock so when it was discovered the following morning only the packaging disintegrated. Many products would have been ruined.

R295WQ182SZTZK,3,"Photographs included in this review.I have two of these machines. The newest one gave a reading so high that I had stage 1 hypertension, and the older one (when rebatteried and fired up to check the slightly worrying first machine) gave normal to low blood pressure readings. Readings were taken 5 minutes apart and then checked 2 hours later. In, any one of these machines could give a totally random result. As an aside, the one with the higher readings pinches so tight it feels like your hand is going to pop off your arm. Seems like it measures its own pressure, not the wearer's arm",04/01/2022,United Kingdom

R29K9SP9DKDOOX,2,"For £4.99 at the time of purchase this charger provides quality and value 100x over, in my opinion. The weaved cable is robust enough to endure day to day life and use without bending or flexing the internal wires fully being durable and neat at the same time, at 2m it’s the perfect length to have anywhere and comes with a handy cable tie if you want to reduce the length / prevent it becoming a trip hazard in certain environments.The only downside I have is two sided, I find the green led a nice touch however in my mind I thought the light was a charge level indicator at 0% no light then gradually going up in bars as the battery chargers with 100% being fully green. This is not the case however it’s just a solid light, that’s no problem though in my mind the design was slightly different. Be warned if your easily disturbed by light I wouldn’t have this in your bedroom as it’ll keep your room well illuminated for a small light! Could see how this could be a soothing touch for someone who finds comfort in soft ambient lighting, could always double as a nightlight.With a 3 year warranty you’ve got all the protection you need, mega value for money 100% recommend will definitely purchase more.UPDATE - after using for a couple of weeks my phone has displayed the message use a supported charger henceforth this being unusable!

R29LNKU51XAD5F,1,"Only set up this machine a few days ago - not expecting any probs given the bulk of the reviews I read.  (Also, it is not my 1st home BP monitor, if the 1st Cazon - plus, I am a retired RN.)  Surprised to read here it is a Large Cuff! monitor - NOT part of the description I read prior to order - & that explains one of the problems.  I am of average height/weigh less than 9&1/2 st - it's much too long, as well as stiff/unwieldy, cuts into my armpit.  Too-big cuffs tend to give a lower reading - this one pumps up to over 300! before giving me a result which suggests my BP must be blowing my brains out.  On each occasion.  Naturally, worrying.  However, today have used it on a friend - same scenario.  & when comparing both our BPs with the other monitor - which I found out how to recalibrate recently - huge discrepancy.  So this is a dangerous product in my view.  One to avoid.  Just unfortunate that the Returns date lapsed 3 days ago, which suggests no chance of getting my money back.

Therefore if you want to use your lance from an older model it is not compatible.  You also have to use a screwdriver to remove the lance connector. The spray of water is also too wide making it difficult to clean marks on block paving. The previous model worked better and the handle did not keep falling off.

There doesn't seem to be any way to boost the volume and the talk of Dolby sound in the description seems nowhere to be found.The boot up time is rather long for a modern TV with an unstoppable boot screen.The tuner is extremely confusing with many defunct settings that you can't seem to hide as sources either. Not to mention the tuner seems to be difficult to make find stations.Gaming on all my consoles that I have tried on it (PS3, PS4, PS5, Wii U, Switch, Xbox One X & Raspberry Pi) all seem absolutely fine with response time, although haven't seen a gaming mode that some might want.The brightness seems fine for the room I am using it in with good viewing angles.

R2BB1WCS172P2V,1,"Had an older, equivalent version for around 10 years, so when that one died, had no hesitation buying a newer version - oh what a mistake.I’ll start with a couple of relatively lowkey disappointments:1 - there were no clips to wind your power cord up around when you’ve finished, which were present on the older version.2 - the collection bucket felt cheap, and instead of sliding nicely into the slot (like the older version), you have to wiggle & jiggle everytime. Annoying.Worst of all, and I’ve only used it once, the hole that the grass passes through to get into the bucket seems about 20% smaller than the older version. So whilst the bucket is possibly a little larger, the grass struggled to make it in, and instead falls out as I moved round the garden. Everytime I lifted the lid to see how it was going, there was none in the bucket, it all just accumulated at the entrance.How this passed Flymo’s product testing I have no idea - Flymo have let the standards really slide.",15/10/2022,United Kingdom

R2C8NUTEEIYEHY,2,"I have now been using this for almost 2 years and my concerns about longevity are starting to come true.1st - the batteries no longer hold their charge - I find I now have to use both batteries to do the lawn once, before I could get roughly 2 mows per battery.  I purchased a new battery (very hefty price) but also notice that the mower does not seem as strong as it used to be.  2nd - It now struggles on lower grade cuts - so I end up now having to set the level to 4 (used to have it at 2) - which means I will have to cut the lawn more often.original reviewI replaced my petrol lawn mower after 20 years (of hard use).  This mower is very well thought out as it folds down easy and I love that 1 lever adjusts all 4 wheels at the same time.  I have a normal size garden and get around 2 mows for each battery charge.  I would recommend getting this one as it comes with a 2nd battery for roughly £15 more.  To buy a battery separately runs around £80The good - easy start and fold away nicelythe not so good - build quality, I do not get the feeling that this mower will last for more than a few years as the body and wheels are made made of plastic and do not feel like they will stand up to hard usage - I hope I am proved wrong!!",22/08/2018,United Kingdom

R2CEUTL9MRH71P,2,"Bought this over a year ago for my partner (2021 version), it's been used once every 3 to 4 months for a week of twice daily readings for his doctor.At first this was spot on, quiet, worked well via the usb cable (which is far too short to be used comfortably depending where your sockets are), quick to take a reading, and seemed fairly accurate.Less than a year later it's been throwing up error messages, and takes a ridiculously long time to take a reading, to the point your hand turns purple and you feel you're about to faint. But readings (when they finally came) were consistent so for such short term usage he stuck with it.After using a different monitor recently we found this Aile one was giving readings significantly out, 20mmHg high, which has impacted treatment/medication decisions.This device has certainly not been overworked, and it's been handled and stored with care. Very disappointed as this seemed so promising to start with.",16/09/2022,United Kingdom

R2CH0GX6EMXMUC,2,"First time I have come to use it today, to take out some 1 1/4'' screws out of soft wood and it wouldn't do the job on 2 out of 4.  Then when using it to screw new screws back into existing holes it would not do the complete job (stopped rotating) leaving the 1/4"" to 1/2"" needing to be screwed in manually.

R2CL16M4F7RAIW,3,"Probably very good on low power items, but false economy for higher power ones. They drain so fast that you use so many more in same  time period...

I'm not expecting them to sound like my Edifier bookshelf speakers, but I did expect them to sound better than cheap AliExpress Chinese speakers of similar size. They look good but the sound quality is awful.And they're taller than they look, so probably won't fit comfortably under a monitor.",12/11/2021,United Kingdom
R2D7SENKZA6LRK,1,"Always write reviews 12 months after the fact, when you've had time to learn what carnage you bought.  Take my review as gospel.This chair started off well enough, well enough to have folk rush to write a 5 star review... but after a few months the squeaking shows its face, every time you sit down or get up.... squeeeaaakkkkk.  It's the nastiest cheapest sounding squeak you could imagine.  It's horrific, and if in a meeting or call it permeates any kind of noise reduction.And the chair leans slightly to one side when you're sat down on it.  I tried to understand why but couldn't shoehorn a fix, and other people have reported the leaning too so it's something to do with the design or manufacture.  It's not good for your hip posture.And finally, the mouse-wheel fluff they used for padding is dreadful.  It falls apart within the fabric after a few weeks so it feels like you're sitting on a moveable paper mache.STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS.",22/12/2024,United Kingdom

As other reviewers have commented,  it's quite heavy. Not easy to handle takes some getting use to. Not tried any other trimmers so have nothing to compare it to. Will keep it as it will only get used a couple of times a year. It does cut well. Large batteries may it  handle better.",23/05/2022,United Kingdom 
R2DNE0EIFXC1ZR,1,Rubbish to be blunt.  It is like a hoover and only takes a small layer of grass off my large garden.  Compacts the grass well in the bucket but you spend over an hour going over and over it to cut it. Very disappointed.  I already had a big size flymo and I thought this may work just as well but it is more like a light trim.  A neighbour has the same one and he said it is rubbish.  May suit a very narrow small square of grass but not usual average size.  I noticed as I spent a good hour mowing twice my electric bill increased by an extra 20kw,14/01/2024,United Kingdom

Back support is okay but isn’t regulated so you’re sitting in same position all the time. Pretty sturdy and wheels work really nice. However, in terms of comfort it’s cheap. The cushion is thin so after an hour of sitting you can feel the frame through it, which gets uncomfortable. But nothing a pillow can’t fix. It’s also quite low compared to a standard office chair even on the highest setting. It really depends what you’re looking for in a chair, I needed a small chair to fit in my tight gap between my desk and bed and it works great.

R2HBFX3B761CLI,3,"I’ve been told to monitor my blood pressure over a week and ofcourse my old reliable blood pressure monitor would pack up. I chose this one as it was marked down on Black Friday and could be delivered next day.It feels light and not as sturdy as my old one. It can take batteries or you can use usb to power it, although it’s really awkward with the short usb cable provided.I’ve been using it over a week now and I am still struggling with the cuff. If I have it looser fit then the machine will not work, but if I tighten it then it squeezes way too hard and actually hurts. It takes a long time to deflate and at this point I am on the verge of switching it off.I also have a blood pressure monitor on my watch, which always shows normal bp, but this always shows slightly high, so I am not sure which one is accurate.I am actually considering returning this and getting another one.",09/12/2024,United Kingdom

But the worst element is the lack of power.  It cannot push the cuttings through the gap and into the (small) grass box.  It just dumps cuttings all over the lawn.  I have to go around two or three times to 'hoover' up.  So what I gained in not moving the wires, I lose by having to empty the grass box 5 times more often than I did with my wired Bosch.  I doubt it can deal with anything more than moderate length grass.  It just doesn't have the necessary 'oomph'.

Then b) randomly on returning from an app the screen will display only in the top left quarter, i.e. as if the TV was half the size in each dimension. Nothing will persuade it to change other than again unplugging and reconnecting.

R2IHW9P3MR3U84,1,I purchased this desk to replace my work desk due to the standing features.  The base was easy enough to assemble but the problem came with the wood top.  I followed instruction per the guide and the wood would break off around the screw holes when screwing them in.  The second adjustable top was the worst.  All the support assemble broke around the screws and made it impossible to make it sturdy.  I should now use the lift bracket as it would not secure anymore to the base.

R2LBIQDTHT2IYC,1,"The impact detection ""feature"" of this desk is a complete joke. When the desk ""thinks"" it hit something, part of its routine is to stop, and go in the opposite direction for like an inch or two. If it thinks it hit something on its way UP, it stops moving up and moves back down a little bit.... Well what happens, is on its way down, I didn't realize my chair was in its way, and it proceeded to run into the chair. Fine, I think, no big deal. As it keeps traveling down, my instinct was to press the UP button to make it go back up. It goes up for about a few centimeters and then decides that, on its way up, it hit something (it didn't). What happens is that even though I've pressed the up arrow, it sucks itself back down even further. Each time I pressed the arrow key to go UP, it went up just a smidge, and then back down even further than it already was. It snapped the Flexispot keyboard tray completely off its bracket because I literally couldn't make it go back up, it kept sucking itself down on to my chair. Who knows what would have happened if someone was sitting in the char while this was happening...The issue is twofold. The desk simply cannot sense changes in pressure as an impact. My chair, like most office chairs, is on a gas powered lift, so as the desk was moving down, the chair was giving a little bit. Even on its highest impact detection setting (most sensitive) it could not detect this. The desk is also overly sensitive to phantom impacts as well. So on its most sensitive setting, it takes me 5 minutes to get it to raise because it keeps thinking it hit something when literally nothing is in the way, and I'm not even touching the desk.I've resorted to turning impact detection completely off, because at least if it DOES hit something, I can control it, vs it just doing whatever it wants to do.",13/07/2024,United States

R2M9YDAJFJRTDB,2,"It does the job and I won’t send it back...but I wouldn’t recommend it either because of several design flaws.1. As others have said, the cutting head is heavy. Not too bad when trimming vertically, but the more you diverge from the vertical the heavier it gets. Very difficult to manipulate horizontally unless you have strong arms. Bought this to replace my old Ryobi 2-stroke hedge trimmer which became heavy when extended by two sections, but this is heavier!2. Trigger is placed badly – you have to reach out behind you to find it. Worse still, sliding trigger lock has only a slightly raised edge to operate – impossible even to feel it with gloves on.3. Connecting sections way too fiddly. Internal sockets are a bizarre shape and will only connect one way. Outer surface of sections badly in need of a slot/tongue, or alignment arrows, to avoid having to peer inside the section to see if sockets are aligned.4. Heavy cutting edge needs some sort of handle. Its smooth outline makes it very difficult to hold when connecting to a section because there’s nothing to hold on to.5. Cutting edge can’t be adjusted to full 90 degrees like my old Ryobi hedge trimmer. Can’t think of a good reason why not.",25/07/2024,United Kingdom

R2MJ97DK62YA2U,1,I was shocked that this brand is a badly designed product with no housing / cradle to carry the cleaning solution bottle instead there is a crude pull out tube to be put into a bottle on the floor which does not seem to work properly and limits any movement of the unit. The build is cheaply constructed in thin plastic with a flimsy pull up handle also flimsy. All in all I found this washer very poorly constructed with flimsy switch and plastic fittings it would have been easy to add a cradle for the cleaning solution but this is purposely made to make you buy additional parts to properly utilise the cleaning solution. All in all it's a cheaply made housing the pressure rating is no better or worse than most pressure washers that are much cheaper. The single positive is the rotary tool so all in all I cannot recommend this poorly designed tool.,03/05/2022,United Kingdom

Best ones I have found are the Scentsy which are rather expensive but you can find cheaper at about the same price as this Air Wick. With the Electric Scentsy and similar cheaper Diffusers you can choose your own aroma from essential oils and water as many times as you like and run for as many hours as your oil lasts rather than the limited hours in the Air Wick Oil bottle which seems sealed and cannot be topped up.",25/04/2018,United Kingdom

I had seen a youtube video saying this is identical to Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille, except slightly less sillage and less longevity.This scent, which is meant to smell like the Tom Ford fragrance, falls very short of the real thing. It lacks the same depth, complexity, boldness. I find this to be weak and disappointing in comparison, but it is wearable. My husband has even sprayed it on himself.

If you do a have ago, you need  to be armed with up-date passwords for your Wi-fi router and Amazon account if you have one. You also need to have a TV with at least 1 HDMI input socket and a spare mains supply for the gadget. You will also need passwords etc. for streaming services such as Netflix. Is it worth the trouble? Technically it works well and saves you the cost of a new smart telly, but I have personal reservations about the endless sunami of films and TV programmes, mosly American, that streaming floods into your UK home.

Really not great when you have to check your bp and heart rate every day in order to take heart rate and bp controlling medication that can drop both dangerously low if not carefully monitored.

Unless I was sat right by them.Literally wasted my money.Will never waste a penny on anything like this again. I messaged air wick themselves and they basically blamed me. even though it's the product itself that's rubbish.How I can be sat in one room with 5 or 6 of these and still not be able to smell them is insane. The puff literally just goes a little bit up and falls right down. Doesn't spread anywhere even with a window open.If it was just one... It wouldn't be a problem. I'd just get another, but it was all 5 or 6 of them that did the same thing. It's obviously a manufacturing issue. Just think it's downright cheeky for air wick to blame me when I'd explained I'd done everything I was meant to. Horrible customer service and because I stocked up on tons of scents as well, I'm well over a 100 pound down!!",11/07/2024,United Kingdom

I’m going to keep it for now though only because it’s enormously heavy and I have no idea how I would pack it up to return it and it still does function, although not as intended.

R2SKWBRL5920M3,1,"I purchased the CAZON Pressure Monitor with high hopes for its accuracy and durability, but sadly, my experience has been nothing short of disappointing. After just two months of use, the device has completely broken down, leaving me frustrated and dissatisfied with its quality.From the outset, the monitor seemed promising. It boasted advanced features and a sleek design that appealed to me. However, its performance failed to match its outward appearance. Despite following the manufacturer's instructions meticulously, the monitor started exhibiting erratic readings within a few weeks of use. Initially, I attributed this to minor glitches, but soon enough, the device stopped functioning altogether.What's most concerning is the lack of durability exhibited by this product. I expected a pressure monitor to withstand regular use for an extended period, but it fell short of even the most basic expectations. The sudden breakdown not only renders the device useless but also raises questions about its overall construction and reliability.Moreover, the inconvenience caused by the monitor's failure is considerable. Monitoring blood pressure is crucial for many individuals, including myself, and relying on a faulty device adds unnecessary stress and uncertainty to an already important health routine.Given my experience, I cannot in good conscience recommend the CAZON Pressure Monitor to others. Its poor quality and short lifespan make it an unreliable investment, and prospective buyers would be wise to consider alternative options from more reputable brands. Disappointment aside, I hope this review serves as a cautionary tale for those considering purchasing this product.",19/03/2024,United Kingdom

R2UEVTVAEYOY75,3,"The chair was easy to assemble and is comfortable for the most part. The adjustable headrest and lumbar support is appreciated and does a good job relieving lower back strain. It rolls smoothly and is great as a first desk chair. However, I've had this chair for around 4 months, and I'm neither impressed or unimpressed. It's a mostly comfortable chair with its problems.Firstly, the seat is uncomfortable for me. I have to place a pillow on it and if I'm sat upright, I still feel uncomfortable after a while. When the backrest is locked in place it still moves around a lot, with a preference to want to fall on the left or right side - never directly back. It gives the feeling like there's a pole behind you and the chair can only move backwards either side of it.Lastly, it's started squeaking a lot and it's unbearable. I need to source a good lubricant and hope that I can identify where the sound is originating from, which is inconvenient and disappointing, because the chair was a lot better at first.I've seen a lot of reviews praising this chair which is what encouraged me to make a purchase as well, but I wish I had bought a different one.

R2WQDX9J3MLU5Y,1,"Worst piece of kit I've ever bought for prunning hedging, and apple tree branches.  The battery life is poor, and takes ages to recharge. The trimmer keeps cutting out within 20 seconds of use even when it's battery has been charged continuously for 24 hrs.  It then needs a rest before it will start again. Very frustrating. The trimming end is too heavy. I just wonder if the weight of the trimming end is breaking the connection with the power supply hence the cutting out? The belt provided to help support the trimmer is strong enough to do the job however once in the branches of my apple trees  it gets tangled in branches and had to be removed when in use. I suspect a handle part way down the trimmer would have been more use to me. The distance between cutting blades could have been wider as the width precludes large brances from being cut. I believe the trimmer is underpowered, or under torqued. I've got an old Black & Decker trimmer 36V which makes mince meat of the Ryobi. It's like comparing a Ford Fiesta to a Formula 1 racer. Unfortunately the B&D trimmer doesn't have an extendable arm. The shame for me is that I bought it in July and didn't use it until now, meaning the window to return it has now closed. My advice look elsewhere for a similar product, ot try the Ryobi out as soon as you buy it in order that it can be returned if it doesn't do what you want..",19/09/2021,United Kingdom

I rushed to the hospital and my BP came up relatively normal whilst the monitor still showed that I was close to having a stroke! Cuff is also very small and the metal catch that doubles it over to close often makes the cuff slide to one side so when inflating it really hurts - especially when it decides to inflate above 200 before reading.I have tried monitoring left and then right arm but get the same skewed readings that vary greatly so I don't bother to use anymore.Wouldn't recommend for measuring BP but screen is good, as is the ability to use mains power or batteries.Definitely would not purchase again or recommend to others.",03/12/2023,United Kingdom

R2XUZLP74GPF41,2,"So going to cover the good points first since the table part of the table is pretty good:Table part is solid once assembled which is far more difficult than it needs to be but more on that later, the specific one I went for was the 100x60 black frame/rustic brown top model. The finish on the table part is great and the whole thing is very stable.Unfortunately apart from the fact that the standing aspect of the desk sort of functions that would be the end of the good points.Next I would like to give a warning to anyone looking to purchase this product, firstly add about 6cm either side of the desk for the hooks that come with the desk. In my case I had a very small amount of space to work with and had measured the size needed with very little leeway. I was concerned when I received the item that with the hooks attached I may not have the space clearance needed but decided to proceed anyway trusting that the anti-collision technology advertised in the listing would save me from any potential issues, this was my mistake.The anti-collision claims are complete rubbish, upon raising the height of the desk one of the hooks mentioned previously got caught, the anti-collision aspect was nowhere to be found and there is now a chunk missing from the bottom of the desk after the hook was ripped off the bottom of the desk.Again I only proceeded to try and make the whole thing fit with the hooks due to this advertised feature, since it didn't work and the desk is now damaged I have no idea where i stand on the warranty but since in one of the documentations provided it states that any damage caused during the use of the device is not covered I imagine any such claims would be declined.This is not the end of my issues with the electrical features of this device either, according to the instruction manual I should be able to set the minimum and maximum height the desk can change to, neither of these options work. In fact when pressing the settings button according to the instructions i should be able to switch between S- & S+ both of which do slightly different things such as setting height limits, however no matter if you hold press this button or anything else this cannot be changed and is generally pointless.Luckily the memory buttons do work so it does not impact things too much but still this is not great as if I am reading things correctly in the event of an error the desk will return to the minimum set height, which in my case would damage the desk. So lets hope I don't have any more issues although i'm not going to hold my breath.So far I have covered issues with the device itself. Next would be assembly and company practices.So firstly this company is complete scum, waited specifically for the prime day sale in the hopes of getting a good deal, this desk was the only one i could find within the size limits i needed which was on sale so i decided to go for it. This sale however was a complete lie, I purchased the desk for around £150-£160 but was charged £40-£50 in postage i believe, a few days after the sale had ended I checked the listing again to make sure it had the anti-collision tech advertised due to the previous issue and found that the table was now £200 ish with a £10 postage charge so realistically there was no discount.The box the desk came in was heavily damaged and if this experience has taught me anything in the future any purchases costing more than £50 I will be recording the unboxing from start to finish, opening the box I found all the parts included but some parts specifically of the frame were pre-assembled, chalked this up to it maybe being an out of date instruction set so continued on but as I went on found more and more indications that the frame of the desk at least was second hand. Such as pre assembled parts, dirt/gunk in some of the parts and some admittedly light scratches to the frame.Decided to continue using with putting things together as I could clean the frame and dont need to look at the damage plus figured company likely wouldn't believe me that I had not been the cause without said video. Again lesson learned.Next came assembling the top half of the desk, as others have pointed out the desk comes split into 2 halves along the length, now that it is assembled this is not an issue but the assembly process was awful. Specifically the screws used to secure the 2 sides together were self tapping and they only provide a tiny screwdriver to assemble. I tried as hard as I could to use what they had provided but in the end had to borrow better and larger tools from the inlaws to finish assembly.This is the first time I have ever actually bothered to leave a review on an amazon purchase and personally feel the review is perfectly justified. All I can say is if you intend to buy this item, record your assembly and usage from start to finish.I hope I will never be forced to use this company again as it definitely will not be by choice.",07/08/2022,United Kingdom

R2Y1F62VK2LH3C,1,"The worst problem is the boot for the side that has the controller does not fit, it has a different number than the other side, and the other side not having the wiring harness in the way works fine. Why is it needed, well, without that boot the motor will flip Up/Down in the same direction as the movement, maybe that is fine... but not OK in my book. I was able to get it about a quarter of the way on and had a same size but much longer bolt (Where you see the bolt, that is supposed to be flush with the back, and you shouldn't see a bolt). It seems to hold, but this alone is reason to avoid this product. The second crime of this, is the instructions are pointless, nearly no words just pictures with incomplete ones at that. Such as before putting the top on you have to remove the middle bolts -- but please don't mention such trivial challenges for the customer. The seam is held together by 3 metal bars held there with 2 small wood screws each. While I am sure there are experts out there who can flip a tabletop without flexing it -- it is horrible design to require superhuman powers. (Hats off to the exceptional people who manage that). Bonus round -- the short side did not line up, so it took careful stepping the bolts down from going in on an angle to slowly work them systematically to get it to secure. Pretty sure this misalignment design is what causes a squeak noise at the lowest settings. Bonus round #2, the wood screws are long enough to poke through the table, just held back enough when using the framing (ok so far as that is doing what it is supposed to do) but they do not have any such framing for the cable management that you want to put in there for the wire that connects the two motors. While I had enough experience to know that it isn't necessary to put those in all the way, there are no warnings to the user and seems (like much of this) as if there was exceptionally lazy engineering. It will do the job, and after spending the money, not tossing it in the trash. However, I cannot recommend anyone else go through this experience. Very disappointed.",08/04/2024,United States

However you get what you pay for, the material is on the cheap side, and the chair doesn't ""line up"" perfectly - you can see and feel it is mildly lobsided. There is definitely something out of line on weight distribution most probably caused by this lob-sidedness. The padding of the seat is relatively thin and cannot retain it's shape very well, adding a seat cushion is an option but the problem with weight distribution out beat the little comfort an extra cushion adds.Conclusion is that it is not comfortable enough to sit for too long. It is my office chair so I have to frequently stand up before ache sets in on my bum. The back of the chair is ok though.

My readings on Omron unit 118/75 compared to 101/65 on Aile unit. Similar for other members of family. It's possible the unit we received was faulty but I've had to return it.

R2YU9PIPATWATO,2,I have had a Mountfield electric lawnmower before but chose Greenworks as I wanted something a bit stronger. It is not. It stalls more than the Mountfield these are not powerful machines.But my biggest problem is the batteries. I bought the lawnmower ands trimmer at the same time so I would end up with 4 batteries as one of the main problems I've found is how long they will keep mowing/strimming.Within a few weeks one of the batteries died and will not take a charge. I alerted Greenworks to this and had no response. After a couple of months a second battery has died and will not charge. I'm not sure it will make it to the end of summer ☹️ Not happy as they weren't cheap.,26/07/2023,United Kingdom

R2ZJSUXP4TEYGT,1,Chair arrived and I was able to assemble it without a problem but as soon as I sat on it I could feel it was tilting slightly to one side. Just enough that after a couple of hours working it was causing pain in my back. I had sit with a folded towel on one side of the seat. As well as the tilt it made loud cracking sounds if I moved slightly in any direction.I contacted the seller and they needed me to send a video of it making the noise and pictures of the tilt.They then offered to send me a replacement base plate and said they would send instructions as to how to remove the original one. Base plate arrived but no instructions.So YouTube videos watched..I wouldn't have had the strength to remove it from the gas cylinder by myself but did manage to with help.Chair now not leaning and therefore is at least functioning as an office chair. Still making occasional cracking noises so I don't hold out a lot of hope as to how long it will last.And still not entirely sure how happy I am with having to fix my own brand new office chair!Certainly wouldn't buy this one in the future,17/07/2024,United Kingdom

The hype on YouTube made me blind buy this and I wish I could send it back for a refund or at the least a credit for the price but since it’s considered to be a “FLAMMABLE PRODUCT” you can’t return it. Next time, I’ll read ALL of the 1⭐️, 2⭐️ & 3⭐️ reviews first. Seems like they’re more trustworthy. Then again, it might just be the house that’s making the scent.

R2ZY6N86ZGFY7G,3,"The components - except for the defective part they were shipped with - appear to be good quality and as advertised. That said, if I had received the correct parts to assemble it upon arrival, I would have given it a much higher rating. Now giving it 1 star for 2 reasons: 1) Unacceptable QC/QA: Only after spending 1/2 a day attempting to scrape off the excess paint on the Part #3 connector to modify it to fit with Parts #4 & #5 - the left and right support beams - per the instructions - was it revealed that in an attempt to match the color of the rest of the black desk components, the Connector Part #3 I received had been modified with an extra layer of black over the original brown paint to match the rest of the black desk hardware in the kit. The result was that the extra thickness caused by the extra coat of black paint over the original brown paint made it impossible to insert Connector Part #3 into Parts #4 & #5 - the left and right support beams - per the instructions - even WITH the screws removed - also per the instructions. The end result was that the inclusion of a modified part in this shipment rendered Part #3 nonfunctional and made what SHOULD have been straightforward fast and easy assembly process a complete waste of 1/2 day trying to modify it to fit before learning after contacting Customer Support that they would replace the defective part. 2) After Customer Support asked for an address and phone no. & said ""it"" - which upon further questioning they finally confirmed meant ""the frame""- would not arrive for 5-7 days, if shipping does take the full 7 days, since I will be out of state on business the week it arrives, this will further delay my ability to assemble and use the desk. If the manufacturer could not ship the desk with the correct Part #3, instead of modifying a Part #3 designed for a desk kit with brown hardware by painting another layer of black paint over Part #3 thereby rendering it nonfunctional just to be able to ship it sooner rather than later, the better use of everyone's time would have been for the co. to notify me that they would ship the desk as soon as the correct part #3 became available for the kit I ordered.",19/04/2025,United States

R31L0CVTDKO3PW,2,"The desk is fairly sturdy when constructed.  The drilled holes on the bottom of the desktop are not aligned with the frame, but you are able to drive the screws at an angle and get them in without drilling your own holes.  I was able to do everything by hand without a power drill.The problem with the desk is the material.  When I first opened the desk, it smelled awful.  It was a very sweet smell, kind of like syrup - I have not experienced this before, but solvents often have a ""sweet"" odor.  I live in an apartment so I aired the desktop out on a friend's balcony for over a week, and had it in a ventilated area for weeks after that.I've finally assembled the desk as the sweet smell is not perceptible any longer, but I am having congestion and eye itching while sitting near this desk.  I have to assume the particleboard is off-gassing formaldehyde or other components of the glue used.  The electronic components/plastic on the controller also have a very strong odor that remains perceptible from a normal sitting distance.Products will usually off gas for a decade or more, and that is why I avoid terrible composite materials.  However, it is impossible to find a standing desk this small in natural wood, as far as I could find.  I guess if you are too poor to afford a large house, you might as well have respiratory discomfort and eye itching?It would be nice if this company or some other would offer a wooden desktop option in this size.  I may try and build one myself, though if one were made available I would definitely upgrade.  Particleboard is a terrible material, particularly if you live in a small apartment with no forced air ventilation.  At this point I'm not sure if I'll be able to keep this desk, but I hope I can cope with the issue.",18/05/2023,United States

R33XIIGI5HNB7C,3,"This may be somewhat of a niche issue, but there will be ppl out there pulling the hair out when trying to get the Audio Return Channel (ARC) working via a home theatre setup with something like the Echo Studio.In summary, if you have this Fire TV stick and an Echo Studio, you can (in theory) configure a home theatre setup for your audio. Effectively, the Stick passes audio through to the Echo device.You need a TV that supports ARC, but there appears to be an issue with disconnects, no audio and general bugginess of the stick.  Every time they provide an update for the stick it seems to breaks the home cinema setup and you will end up rebooting, restarting and resetting the stick and there's a 50/50 chance that it may fix the issues. I persisted for 5 months, but it finally reached a point of being pointless, so I returned it as faulty for my needs. I now just use Bluetooth to connect the Studio to my TV which is okay, but not refined.So, if you want the Fire TV stick for anything other than an ARC setup, go for it. But if you wanted to use ARC this will not be the reliable solution. It would be better to put the money towards a dedicated sound bar.I hope this helps and saves you some £ if ARC was your reason for buying one",10/04/2024,United Kingdom

R344H41O3WL131,1,"The designers didn't think hard enough. Instead of placing the motor close to the battery and transferring the drive via a spinning rod through the handle, they opted to put the motor next to the blade.

Luckily, my partner had a small computer speaker which he was able to plug into the headphone jack and the sound is much improved. Otherwise I'd be sending the TV back. The TV guide is sub par and confusing. Instead of displaying several channels with the programmes that are currently on, the EPG shows eight channels, but only displays programmes for a single highlighted channel. So you have to go through each channel individually, which is a bit of a pain when there are over one hundred channels.

This is NOT a bad chair. The last chair I bought was three times the price of this one. As such it was definitely better quality. Was it three times better than this one? I don't know.

The Vesa mount was useful and fitted fine. Sound level is OK for our kitchen and was at 50% for a 8 metre distance. It supports HD Tv but has problems. Remote is easy to use, and has a sleep timer function, it also will auto power off after an adjustable ECO time. The brightness is fine.The bad:The picture has a lot of motion artefacts (even when all processing turned off). The picture on HD channels blank out briefly at random intervals. I have a 92% signal and 100% quality on the affected channels using the info display, so this should not happen. The worst problem with this the VA display,  the viewing angle is appalling.

It is OK straight on, sit slightly to the left or right or down a little and it is awful.I have given it 3 starts for looks, features and sound. Picture is important.

The other 4 did not fast charge and this was possibly indicated by a dimmer green light on the leads. Very odd and very disappointed. Have thrown away the packaging so probably can't get my money back or a working replacement. It's even more of a shame because it was one of only a few leads that could fast change my daughters phone due to her phones worn power input port.

Having read the reviews on here I was expecting something amazing but to be honest they are not all that .The positives :-They are aesthetically pleasing , a very stylish diffuser in black and gold that unlike others don’t look tacky in your room .The occasional burst of scent is admittedly pleasant for the 30 or so seconds that it lastsThe Negatives :-The boast that it lasts up to 45 days on the packaging is probably true if you have the diffuser on its lowest setting. However , if you do you probably won’t even get to notice the scent for any sustained period of time . If you have the diffuser on its highest setting then you will get more bursts of the pleasant scent  , just don’t expect the refill to last much over a week . At approximately £6 a refill I don’t think it represents good value .Think I’d rather purchase a decent air freshener and give it the occasional squirt myself",13/11/2024,United Kingdom 
R3A18G67OIVGJT,3,"This is a device firmly at the budget end of the Karcher range and it shows. The plastic moulded case is not robust and will not stand any form of rough treatment. It is easy to assemble and operation is really simple. I found it useful for cleaning stone, masonery and brick, but useless at anything else.Like all power washers there's always a problem with the complexity of leads in and out of the machine. It needs a power cord and a water source input and both of these have to be manoeuvred around with the device when in use. It's a pain. The pressure washing wand comes with a self knotting hose which will get on your nerves. No matter how you unravel the hose it will self tangle and get in the way. At times it did feel like I spent more time on hose and cable management than on pressure washing. I did manage to clean my patio and driveway, but in no way I am looking forward to getting the device out of the shed again.",04/03/2024,United Kingdom

R3A517X68U9YLK,3,"Finally I found a TV that has all the connections I need (especially an AV one 4 my PS2). Too bad it only has ×3 HDMIs, I expected 4, but it has come as advertised. Of course the connectors are all at the back (which is a bit of a shame), so of course I payed for Amazon's TV Engineers to install it. In which they came on: Tue 4th June (06.) 2024. @12:30pm-1:00pm. Now the brightness is way too bright-you'll need to change it in the settings. Which are complex. As you can see there is not just a brightness button but a whole range of settings for it. I wish it was simpler & had just a brightness button. Appearance looks fine, but it is small & thin-which I personally dislike, since: it makes it harder to hold & more fragile.  So I bought the same TV but bigger (50 "") and gave this old one to HH (Hope Housing) on: Thur 25th July (07.) 2024. Because I highly doubt Amazon would refund me especially right now. I mean it has been past 30 days. Performance is fantastic-haven't had a an issue with this as far as I'm aware. Luckily I've had that TV enginner install it for me; since the instalation process looked hard-I mean for flip sakes you have to register for this with Roku, which is stupid. During it I believe there was a card check also-just to check if you're an adult. This being even more dumb/ridicolous. Delivery is fast though. Literally ordered it on: Fri 31st May (05.) 2024. And got it the next day: Sat 1st June (06.) 2024. The signal & channels are great though and has all you need.

R3B27TB7W35L2M,1,"I'm giving the desk 3 stars, leaning 3.5, because functionally it is fine. It is sturdy, looks nice, motors operate well; as a desk it is fine.That being said, there are some really inexcusable issues for the price point that FlexiSpot is at that don't even exist on no-name brand bottom of the barrel for price I've built in the past.For reference, this is the third standing desk I've built off Amazon. One for me when COVID hit that was truly a ""don't know if this will work"" cheap purchase, one for my wife, and now this one.I bought the bamboo kit with the desk top included after going back and forth over getting a butcher's block and sanding/staining it in my apartment. After agonizing over it for a while I went with the combo from FlexiSpot. The top and the stand ship from two different locations at two different speeds, but you only get one tracking number. This meant that the base was out for delivery so I disassembled my current desk, it showed up, but no top. There is a note on the box that says it will ship separately.It took three extra days to arrive, so I jumped ahead a bit and had to plan my week around a desktop showing up at no known date.Second issue as many others have mentioned, the screw holes on the desk only partially match (just the outer support holes). There is no holes (not misaligned, they just don't exist) for the center support screws. The holes for the motor panel don't even align with this model for 2/3rds of them, they just don't exist.With that said you'll want a screwdriver handy and potentially a small bit drill to get starter holes because the self tapping screws aren't very good at biting.I'd expect this on a barely $100 desk, but at $600 it is kind of ridiculous that they're clearly just reusing stock and not bothering to update it to match the kit they're shipping now. In fact, the old desk I was upgrading from (size was too small and sturdiness was an issue) did have all the correct hole patterns, so it seems kind of insane that at 6x the price and a ""name brand"" in the space these don't even have an attempt at 6 of the holes you need to screw in.I was able to put it together by myself, just putting a warning out there for others that may have more of an issue with that.3.5/5, it's fine, as a desk it seems like it will work well, but such simple things are poorly managed from an industry leader here.",28/06/2024,United States

I even pushed the monitor right up against the wall to prevent it, but as you can see in the video, it's not only dangerous, but very cheaply made. Also, I made sure that all four legs are perfectly flat on my floor so it doesn't rock because of that.

R3CUBCIDS3JIY8,2,"For me (and probably for most people) the most important element of a television is the picture quality.Being technically gifted, and having a very keen eye for detail, it falls upon me to set up the four televisions in our house.  Three of the four, are an old, inexpensive 32 inch Bush HD television, in one room, and (we had) two inexpensive, 32 inch JMB HD televisions in two other rooms.  I’m mentioning these tv’s because although they were cheap, they were literally plug-in and play.  There was no need to adjust the picture settings whatsoever. They produce deep black, crisp white, and the perfect amount of brightness , contrast, and the colour, so that the picture quality was like anything else in the real world.  It was like looking out of a window which (in my humble opinion), is how an HD or UHD television should be set.The picture quality of our cheap HD tv’s is the level of quality I’d expect from much more expensive televisions, but these were cheap and old (as in when HD first became available).I said all that, to say this: By contrast, this RCA tv is definitely not a plug-in and play tv, unless you don’t care if the picture actually looks natural.  I can accept that there may be some picture setting adjustments required, but when someone like myself find it impossible to achieve even a reasonable picture from it; then, that’s not good.  The kicker is, my wife who is not technical, and has absolutely no idea how to set up a television, could tell that the picture quality was exceptionally bad.  She’d been accustomed to watching the old Bush tv which I thought we’d replace with the new RCA, and put the Bush tv in a guest bedroom where the JMB tv had finally given up the ghost after many years of outstanding service.I was reluctant to put a brand new tv in the guest room because it’s not used enough to warrant it, so I went through all the trouble of hanging the RCA in the master bedroom.  That was a mistake.  After all the trouble of hanging it, I could not (with all my technical skill) get a picture quality that even my wife (who is not technical) could appreciate.

I am not overly tall either (6 ft). I would have liked to flag this as an issue but there seems to be no way to do this, other than to return it.

I bought this to replace a previous generation firestick which  seems to be slowly dying. I connected that to my cable network via an adapter bought from Amazon. Although the connector is the same, it doesn't seem to allow me to have a wired connection - or in any case it's not working. Only wireless networks show up.

The four legs definitely help.Value - For less than $300, this desk is a good value... However, it has flaws.Flaws - The cross bars bend when screwing them into the uprights. This does not take much force and does not seem to affect anything, but I know they are bent.The assembly instructions leave a lot to be desired. When assembling the top, it doesn't specifically mention to do it upside down, then flip the supports down to screw them in. I may have damaged the pegs holding the top together lifting it because I didn't understand this from the instructions. There are other unclear factors in the instructions, that's just the largest one.The ""socket"" wrench supplied is a huge pain. Much easier just to use your own 10 mm deep socket on a 1/4"" drive.The screws for the bracket which supports the power supply are too long and caused the top to dimple where they pushed up from below.There is no way to route the cabling to the control panel without going under the crossbar.

I took my first reading and it was 160/128!!!!! Heart rate 70...Is that even possible!! I took it again 122/86 HR 80. Other readings have been as high as 158/116 HR 65 . Another reading 116/76 HR 77 which is the kind of reading that my old machine gave. How are we meant to know what our actual blood pressure is with such random readings like this?! It's enough to make us either ill or obsessed with checking it.At other times the cuff has inflated so much that I had to rip it off because it felt like my arm was going to explode.I wish I hadn't thrown the packaging away because I really regret paying for a machine that is causing me more stress than peace of mind.,16/09/2023,United Kingdom

R3FKHQC7AF3XLQ,3,"Coming from someone who uses several professional hedge cutters for work purposes, this is rather tricky to use and overall a mixed bag. However, considering the price it's pretty decent for home use (which is what I purchased it for), but here are some things I think are worth knowing:- I arrogantly ignored the other reviews about weight before purchasing, thinking the comments were coming from those who don't use hedge cutters often, but no this thing is rather heavy. The issue is that it's top heavy with the trigger controls at the far opposite end. Imagine you have a long pole with a tiny grip and a lump of metal at the far end, that's what its like to try and wield this. It's especially bad when you use the extension pole to extend it over 2 metres.- The harness doesn't really do much to support the weight and I ended up taking it off at times- Considering the price, you get an alright bit of kit here which is decently well made in terms of the quality and performance. It cuts fine, has a nice sweeper attachment which helps remove cuttings if you're doing the top of a hedge. I used a 5.0Ah battery for about 45 minutes and only lost one bar of charge. The noise levels are low at 95dB but still wore ear protection as it's over 85. Would also recommend a face shield or some kind of goggles at the very least, I had a piece of hedge shoot towards my eye the first time I used it and luckily I had a shield on but I could see the mark it left...- Two issues I have with the design is that the trigger and grip are at the very bottom of the device and the adjustable angles aren't great for cutting the sides of a hedge. I'm used to holding the grip further up as it gives you far more control and makes the weight distribution a lot better. The grip and trigger can also be uncomfortable to use on the hands, you have to awkwardly slide the safety switch up and then grip the trigger rather tightly as there's a lot of resistance in the trigger itself. This is especially difficult when tilting the device on its side to cut along the side of a hedge. I get that its a safety feature so that it doesn't turn on easily but yeah, it wares the user out quickly and cramps up your hand. The adjustable head works well for the tops of hedges, but typically when you're cutting the side you want to angle it slightly away from the hedge so that you never accidentally point inwards and gouge chunks out - this isn't possible with the Ryobi as the only adjustable point for pointing away from the hedge is almost a 45 degree angle which is too much.- The reach is very good, I did most of the garden without the extension, and then the tops of some tall hedges with the extension. It gives a lot of reach but it's very hard to control at that height and considerably more heavy as you're putting the heaviest part even further away from where you're holding onto.My review may put people off but for the price I'd say it isn't an awful piece of equipment. For me it came down to the fact that I already had their charger and battery, so it made sense to get this instead of another brand. After the first 20 minutes I got the hang of the weight and how to control it, and after that it felt a bit better to use. It's great for casual use, and I'd even think about using it if starting out self-employed, but for longer use periods, bigger projects, or well established self-employed gardeners this isn't an obvious choice. You'd need to pay 4-8 times the amount for excellent kit, so that's worth weighing up.",01/03/2025,United Kingdom

R3GN8QOR4UGXO0,2,"UPDATE:I'm knocking down my review a bit now that I've had this desk for a while. Unfortunately, the lowest setting (28.7"") on this desk is just way too high unless you're (according to desk height calculators) 5'9.5 or taller.I am 5'4 (average height of US women) and I have to sit on top of pillows (since my chair is already adjusted to maximum height) in order to keep my elbows above the desk, but because of this, my feet dangle causing me to have to sit cross-legged on my chair which is not ergonomic at all. If you spend a decent chunk of time sitting when you're working at the computer, this will really catch up to you after a few months.I find this to be a major design flaw since globally 60% of men and 99% of women are under 5'10. I really love this desk otherwise, so if you are in that 20% of the population 5'10 and over then jump on this, but if you're in the other 80% of the population, I'd recommend looking for something different.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I’m loving this desk! I knew that the seam on the split top desks (that aren’t even that much cheaper) would drive me wild, so I was very happy to see that Flexispot sells whole piece desks. I wish I stood at it more….. but the adjustability is perfect for both myself and my partner to sit at comfortably.  The 48” size is perfect. Sometimes I wish that I had gotten the 55” so that I had room for a second monitor without things feeling off centered, but the 48” is great for making sure I keep my space clean :) For reference my laptop is a 17.3”, so quite a bit larger than a standard laptop.Shipping was fast, I love the bamboo finish, and it was super fast to throw together. The included cord tray and hooks are a great touch. I definitely didn’t need the height memory as much as I thought I would, but I dig the usb and usb-c chargers and get a surprising amount of use from them. I run the adjustments on this quite often to push in my chair at night (the arms catch the cross beam otherwise) and haven’t encountered any issues.I definitely would buy this again if I needed a desk!",26/04/2023,United States

R3HIXAAWNCSM11,3,"Despite some glowing reviews this chair is uncomfortable. The seat is hard and it has no back support. I wanted to return it but disassembling the hydraulics is almost impossible. It can't therefore be retuned as it won't go back in the box. In addition, there is no collection available and it has to be taken to a returns centre. The seller offered me a £15 refund which I have accepted. Now I have to find a home for the chair. A lesson learned, don't buy this kind of thing online!",14/09/2024,United Kingdom
R3HLSPWPZVA4AM,3,"This is not the chair I was expecting it to be, it seems a bit small and flimsy. The white plastic discs that cover screws on the chair keep falling out.

I have already started looking for another chair.",28/07/2024,United Kingdom
R3HMIDO9LII65E,1,"I was very happy with this cordless drill at first. It's lightweight and easy to use, and it has plenty of power. However, after it ran out of charge for the first time, I realized that the battery wasn't charging properly. The indicator light would show that the battery was charging, but when I went to use the drill, the battery would be dead.Overall, I'm disappointed with this cordless drill.

R3HRO0QTMCWKX4,1,"The TV cannot be wall mounted because of systematic manufacturing fault. Vesa mount for a wall bracket has x4 metal inserts into which strong fixing screws are engaged. But, from the rear, the top left fixing is pushed in too far preventing the mounting screw from engaging! This TV is the largest model acceptable to the wall bracket I purchased. Three screws will not safely secure this TV because of it's weight. RCA ROKU are not aware of the problem because it is only noticeable when you come to mount the TV to a wall and Amazon will not lift a finger to help with the problem, 3 days before Christmas and the second purchase to try to prepare entertainment for Christmas! With exactly the same fault! Amazon? Take the money and run! I am disabled, this is a nightmare!!! Having a TV fall off the wall and injure a child??? Unthinkable. Amazon are now buying 2nd or 3rd class goods from manufacturers... Beware!!! Where is Jeff Bezos?

R3IETJ7I8FK823,1,"They are small, cheap speakers. They sound like really good small cheap speakers. Bass is non existent below 100hz, and there is a hollow resonance around 125hz. They sound a lot better once that is EQ'd out. Mids are actually clean, surprisingly, but the highs are very distorted, almost piercing. They don't sound like they have as much of a V shaped eq as I expected, which is surprising. They're definitely not flat, but the eq isn't too bad. My biggest problem with them is the distorted highs. Anything above about 6khz just sounds really bad, and my ears start feeling fatigued after about an hour of listening.These will work very well for podcasts or YouTube videos, but for music I would recommend something else. Creative's Soundblaster speaker line is a good alternative, or the Klipch Promedia is an excellent set of speakers and can often be found on sale for a great deal.",05/09/2022,United States

After assembling what was left of the chairs we found many defect that the arm rests would easily break and the back support was very weak. They are very easy to put together but I do not recommend buying these, for them to break so quickly. They have lasted only a few months and we have had to buy new ones.

In many ways the FireTV stick is better, but it fails in one key area: BBC iPlayer is currently unreliable on it.

R3NDQCJIB0LJJ,1,"I was expecting a lot from this unit. After all, it's fairly expensive at about $300, plus they advertise a 5 year frame/2 year electronics warranty. I'm sorry to say I'm quite disappointed.The pro's: the packaging was great. No damage to any of the parts. The frame also seems very sturdy.  Seems to be good quality material and workmanship.  Also, it seemed smooth, when it worked. See the con's for more details on this.The so-so's: the actual work surfaces are thinner than expected, and they weren't completely predrilled for assembly.  But I made it work.The con's: well, the unit stopped working after one day.  And I get it, sometimes things like this happen. But...1) I tried the troubleshooting tips in the manual. They didn't work.2) So I tried calling the toll free number listed in the manual, and on the customer service card that was included in the box. No one picked up.  After waiting for a number of minutes listening to the phone ring, a pre-recorded message told me no one was available and to call back later. So I did.3) I tried calling at different times on different days.  No one ever picked up.4) So I emailed customer service, telling them the unit stopped working and none of the troubleshooting tips helped.  What did they do? Emailed me a list of troubleshooting tips try. And - get this - if they didn't work, I was to send them a video of me trying the troubleshooting so they could then figure out what's wrong.5) after a few back and forth emails, and providing a video, the best suggestion I get from them is to ""hold the down button for a few seconds and hopefully it'll work."" It didn't.6) I'm still waiting for a response by email.  And they're still not picking up the phone.So my advice to you is: if you buy this unit and it works for you, you'll probably be happy.  Just hope you never have to contact customer service.UPDATE 2/2/22: I finally got a response from the Flexispot customer service, and they're replacing the control panel, plus the one leg that has the motor on it.  HOWEVER, that was 10 days ago, and I still don't have my parts.  Or a working desk, for that matter.  To make things worse, they couldn't provide a tracking number. Seriously, can this get much worse?  I'll update this review if I ever get my parts.UPDATE 2/7/22: today (5 days later) I was told by the Flexispot customer service that they would not be sending me the replacement parts and want me to ship the defective unit back to them.  Keep in mind that the desk is built and the box was recycled long ago.  I'm not sure how this is going to work out.  I'll keep you posted.UPDATE 2/8/22: today, the Flexispot customer service told me the replacement parts have been shipped but they can't provide me a tracking number.  SMH.  Back to the beginning.....  again.UPDATE: 3/20/22:  Flexispot finally sent me a new unit.  I replaced all the electrical components and got the desk working in 5 minutes.

They are designed to give you GOOD sound.I tried them for a couple of months but I felt there was not enough bass in some cases, and in other cases I felt like they were not providing the full spectrum of the music I was listening to. For example, I listen to vinyl records using the PC speakers and my previous speakers were SAMSON studio monitors. They were GREAT for music, but they were too big and I had to sell them.

First, my old mat didn't have the anti slip. This is ok as it is stated and i simply didn't realise so my fault. However I recommend buying one that slips i.e. does not have anti slip as every time you move in your chair or change your body position you will invariably change your wrist position and so will need to adjust the mouse mat. Not a problem with the item, just personal preference.My problem with this item is it's very strong smell. It is a very chemical smell, plastics fresh from the factory? I don't know. But when I received the mat (swift delivery btw!:) the smell was so bad that within 3 minutes of using it I got a headache and my entire room smelt. So I hung the mat on the laundry line in the garden. First for a day then had a sniff, still bad. a week later, still bad. about 2 weeks of airing in the garden I finally took it in and am using it now. While my room does not smell of the item anymore, my hands/wrists do after using it for a few minutes.

R3QT4Z38M02APH,2,"Firstly, the good news; the smell reported in earlier reviews isn't there. It's pretty much odourless.But here are the negatives;(1) the working surface of the pad is too small. I have a high resolution vertical mouse, which occupies slightly less space than a standard mouse mouse, and I still have to lift off to get to the extremes of the screen. If it was a plain rectangle or 30mm bigger in both directions it would probably be ok.(2) the gel wrist support is very hard and sits right under where I had my carpal tunnel release (5 years ago, so no residual pain). The result is that the wrist support digs into the now unprotected median nerve and causes both finger numbness (remember that?) and pain around the wrist area. This is by no means an ergonomic solution, and I can't believe it would help somebody who hasn't had surgery for this condition either.In summary, I suspect that following complaints about the smell, the manufacturer has changed the formulation of the gel making it a much harder material. This is going to cause you a world of pain if you have a carpal tunnel issues. Landfill.",23/05/2022,United Kingdom

I does keep things cheaper, but it would solve the next problem.I found the cables aren't that long and connect oddly to the right speaker, not the left as is customary. soI ended up with the left speaker on the right and vice versa. A built in sound card could have provided a solution, as would a hardware switch, but again, cheap is the game.

R3S1AJ8SP2XTHR,2,Sadly I've had to return this lawnmower as the batteries lose their power over time. I was impressed when I first got it and was able to use it for the last cut of the season. It mowed both my front and back lawn on just one battery. I put it away for the winter and have now completed three cuts. One battery no longer cuts the two lawns anymore and struggles to cut one.  Initially I put this down to the longer grass from the winter (I had to charge both batteries twice to mow both lawns)  but even now I'm mowing weekly it is still taking more than two fully charged batteries to cut the lawns. I'm having to wait for the first battery to charge enough to finish them off.  This is not the first cordless mower I've had. The other needed a new battery in the end so it makes them a particularly expensive piece of kit as the batteries aren't cheap. They therefore cannot claim to be environmentally friendly as disposing of the batteries are harmful. They just don't last.,27/05/2024,United Kingdom

The assembley process was easy and the instructions are were clear.I do have two issues, the grass box is very small, my lawn is about 5mx5m and I have to empty it about 4 times per cut. Its not a massive issue as the as its so light that taking the amount to the garden waste bin becomes quite tiresome when you are trying to cut the grass quickly!The second issue is build quality, I have used Flymo mowers, for more that 25 years and never really had any issues, this one however has very poor build quality. The plastic is very thin and if not correctly placed could buckle or break in the assembly. The other issue with build quality relates to the plastic hinge/retaining bolt that holds the handle to the mower, this broke after only two mows, and I have replaced it with a metal bolt I had lying around.Overall, ok for the price but build quality lets it down.",19/12/2023,United Kingdom

Turning the volume control affected the level of static; turning it directly to the middle (or facing straight down) had the best effect at removing the fault but all sound disappeared from the faulty speaker along with it!Maybe I got unlucky but every speaker seemed to have a number of bad reviews and the design for these looked slick (and still look pretty nice in person too).

R3V9WMQQ5NPMQG,3,"Some people have said they thought this was light. As in 'not heavy'. That's false. It might be light compared to a petrol hedge trimmer atop a pole, but that does not in of itself make it 'light'. Just a 15 minute trim of a beech hedge and your forearms will tell you to quit.But is there a better option? Perhaps a pole saw.The problem is both the weight distribution (as mentioned elsewhere) and the fact you're dragging a hedge trimmer across a hedge, not just the blades themselves. This makes it extremely unweildy and downright tiresome when it catches and sticks every six inches of travel.As for the cut, well it is marginally better than normal trimmers but the reality is that you simply cannot get decent leverage from far below the intended cut. It's a huge struggle for cutting back thick growth and you need to be very strong to weild it.",19/03/2023,United Kingdom

R4BYG3QEG4JWG,1,"This is just a basic issue with sit-stand desks. They wobble front to back and side to side, especially when I’m raised position. That said, this desk does more front-to-back wobble than others and so much so that I can’t even write notes while on Zoom or the desk shake causes my web cam to shake as well when cam is sitting on my monitor.I found a site that tested wobble on desks and explained the design elements (think cross brace for one) needed to reduce the motion. This desk is actually lacking all of those elements. The materials are heavy-gage, but unfortunately the wobble motion renders it unusable for video conferencing, gaming or work like Photoshop where your mouse or stylus will be moving a lot and will this cause this desk the wobble front-to-back and shake your monitor.Testing website was btod dot com and desks that rate well on motion are unfortunately twice as expensive as this one or more, unless you can find the #2 ranked IKEA desk in stock.I like the look of this desk, but the motion is just not tolerable.

R5DVACTAEN5B2,2,"I have a small lawn and had a flymo with cord. Last year I bought a cordless strimmer and it was great, so when my flymo broke I decided to get this. Firstly it is a lot heavier than a flymo even without the battery which I don't like. Secondly I could not get the handles to move or the locking pins to stay in place so I can only mow with the handles set at a bad angle. As I cannot move them forward the mower is difficult to store and also because of this it makes it difficult to turn corners and I now mow the lawn in a circle!

Seriously, I'm typing this review with my monitor and it is just wobbling and shaking like crazy - it gives me a headache, ugh.But here's the issue. This thing just doesn't work! I've wanted a standing desk forever, and was so excited to use this. I got it all put together, went ""Ugh"" at the shaky build quality, and decided to give it a shot anyway.Well, first issue: The UP button moves the desk down, and the DOWN button moves the desk up. But even worse, the rest function (which the manual says is supposed to move the desk all the way down) instead moves the desk all the way up, and then I get a red light come on the keypad, and the whole desk is just frozen.Unplugging and plugging it back in SOMETIMES resets it, but then after a few UPs and DOWNs, red light again, dead keypad.No way to reach out the seller in the packaging material or instruction manual, which is dubious at best, and alarming at worst.I will update this review if a resolution comes, but for now, I'm beyond disappointed.Even a FAQ/Troubleshooting - what to do if a red light comes on, what to do if the buttons are reversed, where to email for help/questions… but I got none of that.My advice is to stay away from this cheap, fly-by-night manufacturer. Sad to say, and I so wanted to love this desk. Man…",16/10/2024,United States

This is extremely light scented and I would say it is towards the lighter end of the scent spectrum like an eau de fraiche. Need a few sprays and lasts about 2 hours or less.

At first, I was confused as the green light was very faint. All the cables were the same. They also charge my phone very slow, which is strange because they are the exact same cables as before. I’ve asked other people to test this, and they have the same. Only 2 of them work with Apple CarPlay, but even then it can cut out and I need to pull over and try to fix the cable.

R9PBC2FH2E122,2,When I first began using these Jan 24 I was so pleased. They were quick and I rated them far better than even a Samsung charger. However its now mid march and I need new ones. My phone (samsung note ) now comes up with a message warning slow charger ... It certainly didn't in the beginning. The different lengths are a great feature in the pack though. In a house with teenagers we have chargers in every room (of course they need a decent amount of charge before they vacate to the bathroom for hours ).

It was showing my blood pressure as so high that I've been taken off some quite key medication while we investigate. It turns out that the (accurate) blood pressure machine supplied by my doctor reads my systolic pressure as at least 20 points lower than this machine does every time.So this machine gave me readings so high that it's going to cost me a couple of months of testing and messing around before I can get on with my life again.

RA4ENVP66D8N9,3,"I’ll say this: for the price, it’s good value. Comfy enough, looks decent – a nice addition to my home office. But here’s the rub (and believe me, you’ll hear the rub): it’s a bit... squeaky. Not ""mildly amusing sitcom-level squeaky,"" but full-on “Are we filming a low-budget horror movie?” squeaky.Sit still, and you’re golden. Move even slightly – adjust your posture, lean back, or God forbid, swivel – and it’s like the chair’s auditioning to be in a percussion band. The 90° flip-up armrests are nice, but I reckon they’re just there to distract you from the symphony of squeaks the rest of the chair produces.In summary: a bargain if you plan to sit motionless, but if you like to fidget or recline, you’ll find yourself questioning life choices.

The screws weren’t packaged in any sort of order and were just loose. We sent that one back and another one was delivered efficiently. The same tv engineer installed it for my mum and it worked fine for a couple of weeks. Then she lost all picture and sound and got a message saying ‘please wait’.

RAKILYE7EEX3Q,2,"I'm currently using these speakers as my ""desktop speakers"" because I just haven't bought another set yet. But I'm not crazy about them. Cons: While the sound is pretty clear and doesn't sound cheap, the volume has a strange way about it, and there's no bass or treble control buttons. The turn on/volume knob that you turn takes a long way to turn before hearing the volume, therefore leaving you with less ability to turn it up louder. So because of this I had to install a sound & volume program on my computer to boost the volume up to use with these speakers. The physical design of them looks cool to the eye, but I find it difficult to place them somewhere that's not awkward. Pro's: They have a bit of weight to them, which tells me they aren't cheaply put together. Their structure is definitely solid and the input cords and plug in cord are lengthy enough to be able to move them around different kinds of desks.",15/10/2023,United States

Unfortunately the fire stick 4k is no better/ possibly worse.Set up was a joke. There were about 5 update screens and had to log in via QR code twice. Not only that but it gets you to download the fire TV app which you didn’t have to before. After 20 minutes of slow updates you have to fight past various screens trying to sell you Amazon services and download sponsored apps. If it were a free product this wouldn’t be so bad, but it was a gift which was quite embarrassing.I can’t recommend it. It’s slow. The power cord is too short.

The tabletop is actually about 59.5""x29.5"" instead of 60""x30"", but that's no biggie. My main gripe is with the assembly. The manual shows a tool that looks like a power screwdriver and casually mentions in tiny print that you need a drill. Guess what, DRILLING is required, too. Seriously?! I get that some people might enjoy marking 18 holes, choosing a 7/64"" bit, and making sure each hole is 10 mm deep, but that's not my jam.

RHBIQJN7472HP,2,"UPDATE : 22/3/22I regret having to downgrade the rating of this monitor from five to two stars.  Although it worked well during its life, its life was short, not quite nine months, before it stopped functioning. It would inflate, but not deflate, leaving my arm tingling and painful, displaying only a code Er 1 and occasionally Er 2. Nothing coaxed it back to working condition. Although its cost had been modest, its short working life meant that it worked out more expensive than my five year old Omron, which is still working.Durability and reliability are part of a product rating as well as performance.  This had been my travel monitor because of its compact size. Don't want to be travelling abroad without a working BP monitor. Back to Omron. Buy cheap, buy often, they say.---------------------I bought this in order to have a more portable BP monitor to take with me on journeys where space and weight are at a premium.It is simple to use, just put on the cuff in the right position, and push the start button. Given the low cost, I was surprised by the accuracy and repeatability of the readings, which I compared with my Omron MT10IT. They are the same to within +/- 3mmHg in both systolic (upper figure) and diastolic (lower figure) readings, which is no more than natural variability between readings.Unlike the Omron, there is no facility to transfer readings to a PC, but I knew that anyway, and up to 99 readings can be stored for each of the two user settings on the Aile monitor. The memory function shows the average of recent readings, and allows you to cycle through past readings, which are stored with date and time. One small caveat is that holding down the memory button will not cycle through past readings more quickly, which is what I'd expected - it clears all readings! You have to press for each reading, but that's not difficult either.Although it wasn't mentioned in the instruction leaflet, the monitor also can detect irregular pulse rhythms, which will, if present, be indicated by extra lines that appear around the 'heart' symbol on the display.There is no separate charger supplied, but there is a micro USB cable so the unit it easy to power, either via a USB cable and a power brick or 4 x AAA batteries. I've found this much preferable to dedicated power adapters. Unlike the reviewer who only got about 40 readings from a set of batteries, I have had approximately 180 readings from a set of four 900mAh rechargeables.",24/10/2021,United Kingdom

It would have been so easy to make this machine great, it cuts grass as you would expect, the battery last more than long enough to cut three medium lawns, then grass collector does it's job. So why 1 Star. The height adjuster does nothing practical, it just makes the, already long thing, longer. The overall length is too much for easily steering around my non-rectangular gardens. To get the thing to change direction (and get the strips in your lawn) I have to stoop down which is uncomfortable. I can only think that they never had anyone over my height every use the thing. A simple ratchet would have solved this. To store it in a compact manner you have to unscrew it at four points, not hard but completely unnecessary when simply quick release would have worked. The cut height adjuster is a flimsy piece of plastic that looks like it will break at any minute. It's not just my version either, I looked at others in their range and they are all the same.

RJ693XNYO9LUC,1,"For some design reason when you use this drill with a 10mm bit (the largest it can take) doing so will cause a malfunction in the chuck mechanism.

Unfortunately the 1st failed outside of any return period. This second one has lasted only a few months since buying it.I can't explain exactly what the problem is, just that it has to do with opening up the drill wide enough to take a 10mm diameter bit. Doing this evidently takes the mechanism past some 'ideal' operating range and causes the chuck first to 'lock' open, then when you try to hold the chuck and overide it (with some grippers or a vice) it results in the whole unit winding itself out of the end of the drill.Anyway, fine up to BUT NOT INCLUDING a 10mm diameter bit.

RKDGQICDK1EU0,3,"TLDR: If you get the 24”D version, the predrilled holes in the desk top will leave you with a 1.5”-2.5” gap between the desk top and a wall because the desk legs are deeper. So if you care about that, consider measuring & drilling your own holes.I got the 63”x24” desk. If I had room for a 28”D desk, or if I wasn’t putting this desk against a wall, I would probably be leaving a 5 star review. The issue with the 24”D desk is that the legs are about 27”D. So if you attach them to the top using the manufacturer’s pre-drilled holes (without measuring first, because obviously), you’re left with min. 1.5” gap between the desk top and a wall. Add an inch or so for baseboards, and you’ll be left with a 2.5” gap as shown in my photos.My boyfriend thinks it’s not a big deal, but I think it looks bad. Not bad enough to return - I think the desk is very good quality, and technically there’s an easy fix if you know the issue ahead of time - but I’m annoyed because now I have to take this whole thing apart, drill a bunch of new holes, and re-assemble if I want to fix the problem.FWIW the actual assembly was pretty easy and straightforward. Again, the quality of the desk is nice. I just wish the legs matched the desk OR the pre drilled holes accommodated the legs OR there was some kind of forewarning about this.Also, I did contact Flexispot to see if maybe got the wrong legs. They responded almost immediately asking for my invoice info, but then never actually answered the question.",08/02/2025,United States

RMEAK6IR8UHST,2,"I have been using 5.1 Creative speakers for my main PC for over 8 years now. They are still working, and give amazing audio. So obviously, when shopping for something to boost the audio quality of my laptop, I ran into Creative Pebbles, I was excited.Talk about disappointing.----------------------- AUDIO QUALITY -----------------------Well, it's.. alright. I mean, compared to the torture of listening to laptop speakers, these will sound amazing, for a day. Then you start noticing how bland their audio is.The audio isn't even neutral. There's a slightly more bass to the audio, which to be honest, is the problem with Creative's speakers no matter 5.1 or 2.0. They seem to love throwing in bass to compensate for audio quality. Basically, you'll need an equalizer to fine-tune the audio to not make it sound awful (again, way better compared to laptop speakers).----------------------- BUILD QUALITY -----------------------Though they feel sturdy at first, the same problem that plagues every Creative speaker, plagues this one.Thin wires that you'll end up accidentally pulling on.In-fact, the Pebbles are round, so I ended up with one rolling off the table and it hanging by the thin wire. These are not going to last long if you are going to use them frequently. Oh and ANOTHER problem that plagues Creative speakers show up here as well.Small wires.Yeah, they love their small wires. Enjoy that few centimeters distance that is awkward to place unless you have a flat table to place the speakers on. You can't use your laptop on, well, your lap, because the speakers are short wired and need to be placed next to the laptop (unless you want to buy extensions, which is just silly for a laptop speaker setup).Oh and there's a flimsy subwoofer attached on top, which you'll constantly end up touching and I bet, one day poking a hole into with your hand.----------------------So in the end, are these still worth buying?Not at the price I bought ( Rs. 2,599). These are worth Rs. 1000, maybe Rs.1500 max. Else just buy a cheap soundbar, unless you plan to watch movies/videos or games, which is why I bought these.",09/11/2024,India

ROW6EH8BE0XK9,3,"For the price, it's alright, which was £40 when bought. The seat is not very cushioned; you will feel the hard wood in the middle of the seat after some time, which gets uncomfortable due to its unevenness. The actual major issue I had with this chair is its rocking ability. In the first few days, it was good until it got very wobbly and always leaned to the left, needing to be moved all the way to the right to make it even again and remove the free lock. It also makes a lot of squeaking noises even when moving around the chair or leaning on one side a tiny bit, which gets very annoying. I am not sure if this is due to me having a faulty one or what, since I've seen nobody mention this. But other than that, everything else like the installation was straightforward and simple. For the price of £40 on sale, it was an okay-ish deal, but there could be better alternatives out there for the same price when they are on sale or spending a bit more for way better comfort.",07/04/2024,United Kingdom

RPJTUYHABNIL8,3,"My old Karcher power washer, which is over 25 years old, was a basic model but made of superior materials compared to this new one. The hose connecting to the lance is made of hard plastic that tends to stay coiled, and both ends that plug into the machine and lance are also plastic, which makes me doubt its durability.Initially, the lance trigger was sticky, but it seems to be improving over time; however, it's also made of hard plastic. don't think it will stand up to much abuse, The hose length between the washer and lance is 5 meters, but it frequently tangles with the power lead and water hose as you have to walk around the car (because of the coiling of the hose) this making it cumbersome to use. The pulling handle feels very flimsy; when I tried to drag the washer around the car along with the water hose and electric cable connected, that's why you have to lift it around the car.After washing one car, the power washer also got very hot when I started to wash the second car.I will keep this as it has a five-year warranty and buy a new longer rubber hose with brass ends that are on Amazon.",16/01/2025,United Kingdom

RPOHUC2MHFUW5,3,"This chair was perfect for what I needed it for at the time - my budget was limited and my previous chair was broken. For context, I'm not a serial chair-breaker, I am around 5'11"" and 90kg, and I'm usually sat on it around 4-7 hours a day.Assembly was easy and quite fun, I had no issues and the tools it came with worked fine. My initial thoughts were that the arm-rests' material was quite sharp; I typically sit in a t-shirt, so my elbows or forearms are directly against the rests, and the depth of the gripped material took some getting used to.I bought this chair about a year ago (January 2024, it is now January 2025) and the chair is noticably listing to the right side. I sit on it relatively straight, but over a year's use it has tilted further and further, to the point where it has a noticable 20 degree slope when empty. This is exacerbated when reclined, as it tilts towards the right. This is fine for me, who has spent a year getting used to it, but anybody else using my chair immediately gets thrown off-balance and complains.As it is holding its structure, but at a 20 degree angle, I determined that it was the internal metal structure that has warped over time. Now, I am by no means skinny, but I definitely did not think of myself as dense enough to bend an apparently indestructible and sturdy chair, so this review comes as a result of a slightly bruised ego.This chair will do you fine if you only have exactly as much money as it costs to buy it, but I am sure that if you shop around or buy a nicer one it will last longer than mine has. The sharp arm-rest issue may also not be a big deal for those in jumpers, hoodies, or with hairy arms; I will leave that up to you to decide.TL;DR: Chair started sharp and ended wonky",20/01/2025,United Kingdom

Thinking it strange that the charger is flashing red, not green, at this point I don't realise what this means. So, I charge the batteries. Then, after a few days I use the lawnmower. It works, but it is SO under-strength that it's laughable... like a child's toy. It mows for around 6 feet before conking out, and continues to fail (on short grass) every additional foot or so. I use the other (supposedly fully charged battery). It conks out in exactly the same way again.Anyway, either (1) the lawnmower is the worst piece of electrical equipment I've bought in 40 years - a child's toy lawnmower has more power. Or (2) the batteries are BOTH defective. Either way, that's pretty rubbish for equipment that cost over £200 to buy. My £80 Roche lawnmower is infinitely more powerful (and that's not great).On the plus side, it's not too heavy for me, and was easy to assemble.

I also find the fabric to be scratchy on the elbows and requires a hoodie or throw over the arms.Initially got this chair when I started working from home, to be a practical office chair to help my posture.

Additionally, the desk top was finally delivered.Original—Very disappointed—they seemed like a legit company, but I feel scammed.The company only shipped one half of the desk. When I never received the top half, I reached out and their customer service told me that they’d ensure that it was shipped immediately. But apparently that didn’t happen.After another 10 days without receiving the desk top, I contacted them again. They then told me that they never shipped the desk top and now it was sold out. Then they stopped responding to my questions.I decided to return the portion of the desk that I did received, but they made that process very difficult and expected me to pay for return shipping (it’s unclear if they were willing to reimburse me—I asked and got a very unhelpful response).Considering how expensive it would be to pay for return shipping on such a large and heavy item, it feels very risky to pay out of pocket and *hope* that FlexiSpot decides to behave professionally and reimburse me. They’ve given me no indication that they’re willing or capable of professionalism to this point.I would never order from this company again—I paid for a product that I can neither use nor easily return.

RUQI85NQHWP1M,3,"Overall Pros & Cons:Pros:1. Cheap.2. Installation tools provided.3, Easy to follow manual.4. Breathable mesh material.5. Cushioning on seat base & some cushioning on head support.6. You can sit on it & it won't break.Cons:1. Cheap feeling & construction.2. Arm-Wrest, seat & head support mesh material can be uncomfortable with direct-skin contact.3. Insufficient cushioning on arm wrest & head support.4. Unsatisfactory quality & adjustability of head-support & terrible adjustability of lower-back support.5. Chair creeks when the tilt pedal is pressed into the chair to lock it from tilting.First things first - This is a budget chair. It is not an impressive chair by any means, but it does the job. I purchased this to replace a ""gaming"" chair that had the metal back support bracket explode, resulting with the chair not having any back/leaning support (the chair would lean so far back, you'd fall off.Assembly - The chair comes with a picture-based, easy-to-follow manual & includes screws, spacers & an Alan key. You do not require any further tools other than what comes with the chair. You also don't need any experience to install the chair (it's that easy, just read the manual).Parts - The screws, spacers & Alan key parts were of a decent quality. No obvious defects or cheap-tool signs like non-centred bit hole on the screw. The screw holes of the chair & chair parts are larger than expected & some screw holes require spacers so the screw holds the parts together properly. My best guess it that the chair has some tolerance for manufacturing variance.Chair - The chair has a breathable mesh material for the back, which feels okay (your clothes layer over it, so it's not too bad.) The chair seat & arm-rest are made of the same mesh like cushioning material (different to the elastic mesh material that makes up the back of the chair. The arm-wrest has little-to-no cushioning to it & the mesh material can feel rough & uncomfortable sometimes, both on the chair & arm-wrest, especially when you wear short & a T-shirt & your legs & arms are rubbing against the material.The plastic construction of the chair looks cheap but the main structure of the chair doesn't seem to be unreasonably flimsy or bendy.The lumbar support is pretty terrible in my opinion - it has 2 ""clicks"" of adjustability & never feels comfortable in any position.The head-support is also pretty unsatisfactory - it's plastic construction looks & feels cheap & the stability of the head-support is pretty flimsy. Adjustability is slightly better than the lumbar support, but it is made of the similarly uncomfortable mesh as the arm-wrest & chair seat base & the head-support has a very flimsy vertical adjustability. It does, however, have a little bit of cushioning which makes it less terrible than the arm-wrest.The ""Tilt-resistance"" knob under the chair requires a lot of twisting in order to slightly adjust the resistance of the chair tilt. The chair makes some creaking noise when you try to tilt backwards with the tilt pedal pressed into the chair, so I personally prefer to keep the pedal pulled out so the chair can tilt freely.The pedal on the chair controls vertical lift of the gas lift (press the pedal up) as well as tilt of the chair (when pulled in/out of the chair). When the pedal allows for tilt, there is no adjustability or locking for how far the chair will tilt. It either tilts or it doesn't.To conclude, I've had this chair for about 2 weeks. So far there are no immediate defects or cracks/breaks that would make me go through the effort of sending the chair back. I am slightly annoyed, however. with the plastic screw hole covers as they tend to pop out after about every half week of using the chair.Would I recommend you buy this chair? If you have a very little budget & don't want to use a second hand chair or need a quick replacement chair that won't give you short term back & head pain, sure it will likely do the job. If you want a chair with consistent higher build quality with better back/head/lumbar support & tilt adjustability, I'd recommend you purchase a different chair.",11/08/2024,United Kingdom

It arrived with box taped up so I think this was once returned and resent out on my purchase....i kept it anyway to try and it's ok for thin stemmed hedge but anything as thick as sprouting sycamore main stems you really have to hack multiple times.  It is a very long reach pole as it says but because it's long it makes it a little difficult to fully control while trimming high tops.  The different angle choices of blade help.  It is heavier than I thought it would be but the strap helps. Charged it after 3 ten minute different intervals 30 min total so not bad.Would have preferred something a little more powerful that could cut through thicker stems but it works fine and perhaps the mm thickness max fir cutting was described in the product description, but can't quite remember.I don't have any other Ryobi products so considering the Ryobi grass strimmer so I can use same battery as hedge trimmerbut still deciding as I need to make sure it can actually cut through grass.",09/07/2020,United Kingdom

Nothing fancy, just so I can hear zoom meetings or whatever. Ordered overnight because of the importance to get new speakers quickly. The speakers arrived packaged loose in a clear plastic bag about the size of a trash bag.  Fairly sure that indicates it was a return even though it is supposed to be a new item in box.Of coarse there was no adapter making it useless to me.  So what do you do?  Return it, amazon holds the extra money for weeks, gotta go stand in like at the fedex store to return it.  Go several more days waiting for replacements to arrive.  Or, go spend more money to buy what should have been included.  Well of coarse I just went and bought an adapter--that's what these companies count on.  It's a common scam now.  Sell you something worthless or not as advertised, but if the price is low it will be too much trouble for most people to deal with the return.The sound quality is cheap.  Its a typical trick you see in cheap speakers.  They amp up the bass output so people with unrefined ears think ""oh man it sounds so full.""  But really the bass is just drowning out the other sound frequencies.  Its annoying--trying to listen to people talk getting muddled up by unnecessary bass frequency.  And when the bass is overbearing, its impossible to turn the volume to a level where you can hear but the people in the next room can't.  The little bass boost switch on the bottom does nothing.  May it switches it from way too much bass to way WAY too much bass.I don't understand why it asks to rate the volume control.  Yeah, the volume control knob works.  Good for you.  You've successfully accomplished using 100 year old tech.  I'm guessing they only want that rated so it will juke the stats.Huge dissappointment.  Would not buy again.

RY9GAITHCTO3W,3,Machine works great but the parts like the handle and the pull handle are badly made. The handle just pushes in and is thin plastic in fact it's not even strong so when u try lift the handle pulls iut as it doesn't clip in properly its like it's too small for the machines slips in and out kf where it should clip in and due to this I've dropped the machine and dented plastic in casing. And the pull handle is the same which means when moving the machine around u have to pick it up and carry it as the wheels fall off when trying to push or pull. I wanted this machine so it was easy to move about as I'm disabled but the handles and wheels are of no use as too thin and flimsy or poorly fitted which considering the price isn't good at all I got this also because I thought this brand were meant to be good and well made when in fact the parts on my 6yr old unbranded machine are stronger so was disappointed whoever the machine itself works well but not as powerful as expected but all the same does the job it's made for. So can't say much more so think before buying and if ur wanting it to be easily koved around thjnk again and u will need to pick it up and carry it.,04/03/2022,United Kingdom

I pretty much buy everything through Amazon so these were no different. I finally got round to sorting out a spare room and creating my new office space last week having ordered these speakers at the end of January. I plugged them in and it took a little while to realise but only 1 speaker is working properly. I have checked all the connections and settings but nothing. The right hand speaker barely even vibrates whilst the left speaker can be pushing out clear loud audio.I’m sure if both speakers are working they are great.However, the problem I have faced is unlike most products I can’t seem to do anything about these faulty items through Amazon. It just directs you to their website.

RYNXDS5ATZJGF,3,"Edit: Update. I was finally able to reach the seller via Amazon messaging and, after sending video and pics, they agreed to send me a new leg. It arrived 4 days later and works fine. So now I have a working desk. Review bumped to 3 stars because the split tabletop is a pain and will probably need to be replaced.So unfortunatley after an hour of assembly, one of the legs will not raise or lower. In my video you can see the rod turning and the mechanics inside the leg are being turned, but that leg will not raise. Tried to see if it was locked up, I was able to forcibly grab the top and pull up but it just slipped right back to the lower position without resistance. I tried calling the support number on the box multiple times. It rings 4x then goes to a busy signal. Packing this up to return is going to be a pain in the rear.Other cons. I got the kind with the TWO top boards ... why is that even a thing? The top board should be a single board. This forces us to screw into the bottom to pull the pieces together at the bracket and then the particle board just falls apart and it's impossible to get tight. The screws looses grip right away or over time. Boards become uneven... It's a mess.Side note, all the reviews of people saying the side bracjets that hold the top ""don't fit the top"", well they put them on wrong. They can go with the L shape out or in, you have to rotate them and put the L shape in to be under the top, then the screw holes line up.",10/02/2022,United States
