R102FPO7272O2N,Sergio,23-Feb-22,TRUE,5,14,Great headset. But it does not have Active Noise Cancelling only for your microphone.,"I just want to start the review making sure people are not confused by the Amazon description. This headset does not have active noise cancelling and you will hear everything around you while using it. What it will do is cancel background noise picked up by your microphone while you are talking to someone else to make sure your voice is clear.<br><br>With that out of the way... this is a great headset, with good range and the microphone sounds slightly better than some of the competitors at this price point. I was surprised by the sound quality and it's more than adequate to play music while working. In terms of ergonomics, it's ok but not amazing and I can wear it for multiple hours without feeling uncomfortable. It stays in place just fine if you don't move your head too much but it starts to fall a little if you look up and down due to its weight.<br><br>Battery life is very good and it was extremely easy to connect to a Mac, Windows laptop and an iPad. It can hold two active connections at the same time which works great between the Windows laptop and the iPad but not that well between the Mac and the PC which seems to be a problem based on other reviews.<br><br>The USB dongle worked fine and has a little LED light that shows whether you are muted/unmuted or in a call. The Windows software is easy to use and configure and it detected everything without problems. Updating the dongle and headset to the latest firmware versions just worked.<br><br>It's a premium (expensive) headset but it delivers, I definitely recommend it.",https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFIOPA6L2DJXMQNP77DLZ57PID4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,United Kingdom,https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/R102FPO7272O2N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B086KBXB3G,
R11KM7C1XX7JJL,Mr. Stephen A. Collins,18-Jul-24,TRUE,4,3,Not noise cancelling but noise Isolating.,"I use a wired version of this headset at work and have been impressed with the sound quality and comfortable fit so decided to get a cordless pair for working from home. These perform just as well as the wired version and offer more freedom to move around when on longer calls.<br><br>Some specific points:<br>These are not noise cancelling, they isolate noise which is very different but still effective.<br><br>I have found that the included dongle has much less range than just pairing it directly with my Mac.<br><br>Batter life is very good as they are fast to charge.<br><br>They are comfortable to wear for extended periods.<br><br>Sometimes people claim that it is hard to hear me but this also happens when using the wired version so it may be dues to the way my employer has implemented teams<br><br>Overall, this is a high quality commercial grade product and it performs really well.",https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFJ7BJSZCMBJAMIACRSZ2SB7H2UQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,United Kingdom,https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/R11KM7C1XX7JJL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B086KBXB3G,

R14JQE4KWJ4WN2,Robert L Monaghan,23-Oct-20,TRUE,4,21,A good headset for the money.,"Before buying this headset I read the other reviews and was concerned that there was a number of 1 star reviews with various grievances, but I've been pleasantly surprised using it.<br><br>You will need to update the firmware on the headset and usb dongle in order to use it to it's full. For some, this fact alone appears to be a big issue, but I feel this is now relatively standard for IT equipment i.e. you need to keep up to date with the latest drivers, software etc.<br><br>The update of the firmware was relatively straightforward. You can update the headset directly from your mobile phone using the jabra app and the bluetooth connection. Alternatively you can download the Jabra direct software and update it that way. The usb dongle can only be updated through your PC/Mac using the jabra direct software, so if you only have a work computer without install rights then this could be annoying for you. I initially tried updating the firmware using my Mac but this failed. There appeared to be an issue with the software on the Mac, so just to be aware. I used my Windows 10 PC to upgrade the firmware without incident, it was very easy.<br><br>The sound quality on the headset is good to my ears, I am no audiophile but I can't tell much difference to my fancy AKG headphones when listening to music.  Others have complained of the volume fade up as sound starts, but I can't say this has bothered me personally. My use case is for skype and teams calls for work and listening to music etc, but if you want to use it for dictation then maybe this will be more of an issue.<br><br>The 'noise cancelling' effect of the headset are pretty limited. It does not have active noise cancelling technology but rather uses passive noise cancelling such as the shape of the earpiece etc (according to their website). To be honest, I don't notice much difference than a decent pair of over the ear headphones, so if you expect perfect silence while wearing them then prepare to be disappointed. You will likely have to spend some serious cash to get very good noise cancellation.<br><br>I've had no issue with connection using both the USB dongle and the Bluetooth function. I've tried connecting to my laptop (dongle) and phone (bluetooth) at the same time, but to be honest find this fiddly as it's not always obvious which device you are controlling when using the buttons on the headset. For example, I wanted to turn the volume down on my PC but it changed the volume on my phone instead. When you are in an active call on one device, usually this becomes the dominant connection. But for me, it's simpler to have it only connected to my work PC.<br><br>I bought the Microsoft teams verified version and after the firmware update is recognized as such by the Teams software. This means the central function button on the headset will call up teams, answer calls etc as expected.<br><br>The call quality has been good in use, and is as clear as my previous wired headset. Much of this is down to internet connection as much as the headset itself, so not much to report in this respect. The microphone is short and so is not located in front of my mouth as my old headset was but it picks up the audio just fine. This is actually good as you can sip water etc with the mic down.<br><br>Someone else had complained about the ergonomics of the design, but I have not has any issues. They are comfortable to wear and lightweight. They do not grip my head tightly, so if you move around a lot they will fall off, but for sitting at a computer, or walking normally around the room they are fine. Sure you can't do HIIT wearing them, but they are not designed with that in mind.<br><br>Another reviewer had complained about the build quality, but again I can't see much wrong with them. Sure they are made from plastic.... but most products of this type are. They are light, but this suits me as I don't want to wear a heavy headset for 8 hours a day. My only comment is that the adjustable band appears to be medium to large in size, so if you have a small head they might not fit very well.<br><br>The battery has lasts for multiple days use after a charge, which is much longer than my other Bluetooth headphones. I have not had them long enough to comment on the robustness of the design to wear and tear or whether the charging cycle will reduce the battery life significantly, so I will update this review in a few months with comments on this.<br><br>Would I recommend them? For the price I paid for them (£135) I would say they have been good. When I looked at the alternative wireless stereo headsets this was one of the cheaper options, and I think they are fit for purpose. Are you going to be blown away by them... no. They do what they've been designed to do, and they do it to a reasonable price point.<br><br>For working in an office/WFH where you want a wireless headset for calls and listening to music then I would recommend. For other use cases, such as gaming or exercise etc you will want to look elsewhere.",https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGXTDLSR2VEYKP3TJDQ3OP2OPNTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,United Kingdom,https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/R14JQE4KWJ4WN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B086KBXB3G,
R17R8L1ANS0T1K,Elocin,17-Jun-23,TRUE,4,3,Not Bad for the Money!,"Since lockdown, like many people, I’ve been working from home and spending a lot of time on Teams. When my old, wired headset packed up (truth be told, my dog found them and had a good old chew), I decided its replacement had to be wireless as I’m tired been chained to my laptop. I’d like to say that I did a lot of research, but I didn’t so I’m pleasantly surprised at how well this purchase turned out.<br><br>The headphones aren’t the cheapest, but I’ve come to believe that you get what you pay for. If you factor in how much time you are going to be using them, then this is probably a bargain. I also managed to get it from Amazon Warehouse which helped!<br><br>I purchased the USB-C headset without the charging station and when I unboxed, I was surprised at how well made the headset felt. Everything these days seems to be cheap plastic. The headband is cushioned at the top to make wearing it more comfortable and it expands to fit all head sizes. I love the feel of the soft carry case and it will offer some protection if you commute to the office.<br><br>Setting up was easy or so I thought. I just connected via Bluetooth without using the dongle which proved to be a mistake. I got really frustrated trying to get the headset to sync properly with Teams. If I raised the microphone arm or pressed mute on the headset, it wasn’t reflected on Teams even though I was muted. It was frustrating and I thought that I would have to just live with it but eventually, I decided to use the dongle and download Jabra Direct software. After that, all the headset functions were in sync.<br><br>I love the fact that I am connected to two devices simultaneously which means I switch between phone and teams calls without any difficulty. The LED lights mean that people know when I’m busy, but this can be switched off if that isn’t something that you like. I’m still getting to understand all the different LED colours so worth reading the manual something I confess; I don’t normally bother (see above).<br><br>Overall, it’s a nice headset, however for me, it has one flaw, I just don’t find them that comfortable. I have to say that I prefer enclosed headphones and they hurt my ears after a period, and I wonder if I should have splashed out and bought the Jabra Evolve2 85.  As I said before you get what you pay for!",https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFV2MWPUKMPPPTFWP2XAW6EUXDRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,United Kingdom,https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/R17R8L1ANS0T1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B086KBXB3G,
R19AHRWL982RGD,Paul D.,24-May-21,TRUE,4,13,Vast improvement over the previous version,"For the past year I’ve been using the original Evolve 65… I found that they felt loose and kept slipping and the ear pads lacked enough padding - plus they felt cheap and horrible considering  the price.<br><br>I was willing to pay full price so opted to get these from Amazon warehouse - granted the box was a bit scuffed up but the content inside was all accounted for and absolutely fine.<br><br>As for the headphones themselves -<br><br>Pros:<br>1. Although no active noise cancelling like other premium headphones, the additional padding and material used really do help reduce background noise (something the originals didn’t do)<br><br>2. The padding…there’s more of it so they feel more comfortable on the ears without plastic parts feeling pressed against you.<br><br>3. It has a silicon gel cushion on the headband that not only adds comfort but reduces your headset shifting about easily.<br><br>4. A more premium feel - I’m almost certain they are still plastic BUT they have been coated in a rubber texture.<br><br>5. Buttons. You have the mute button to the front where as the others are to the back. All with easy access. (Note: my model has a teams button but currently we don’t use it so I have no idea what this is supposed to do)<br><br>Cons:<br><br>The main one is this only fits one way…which is annoying. As I’m on the phone whilst using a computer I prefer to control the headset with my left hand as I’m using the mouse in my right. (Previous models could be adapted to use left or right handed). This is a real shame.<br><br>Overview:<br>Nice decent headphones that are comfy to wear and definitely a huge upgrade from the previous model - are they worth the RRP … definitely not. If you can get them for around £100 or under then they are worth it if you use them daily.<br><br>In the box you do get a nice leatherette pouch that jabra sell for £85 separately - maybe this should be a cheaper case to reduce costs.<br><br>I didn’t get the stand - but was shocked jabra are selling this for £75. The accessories are stupidly expensive.",https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFFBSO7VVY7NU5TZS42ZNIFXIVIQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,United Kingdom,https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/R19AHRWL982RGD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B086KBXB3G,

Sound quality is second-to-none. Perfect for Teams calls. It natively has several features for teams call that I like:<br>- action button for teams on the side<br>- as you swivel your mic up and away, it tells you mic muted, and also lets you know the position of your mic if you want it to.<br><br>I did find when I placed the headset directly over my ears it tended to hurt them after a couple of hours. I adjusted them slightly and released the tightness and moved them off my ears slightly and that solved the issue. It won't affect everyone, it's just because these are not headphones that encompass the ear, they sit on the ear. Just something to think about. I suppose in used to wearing for 4 hours with ear-muff style headsets...I just need to learn these are better for meetings.<br><br>That said Ive used for long periods of listening to music whilst coding, and I can't complain now.

I've synced it with my desktop (using the USB dongle), my laptop and with my phone without ANY problems. This thing just works!

The audio is clear for both calls and music, battery life is good (35 hours with constant daily use). The microphone is excellent, overall a  good purchase if a little pricey.<br>I've been working in a small temporary office at home with my wife, we are both loud and our calls often overlap. The mic is great at excluding extraneous noises, however, I can clearly hear my wife talking when I'm on a call and similarly my wife can hear my music or conversions (at normal levels). I had expected better noise cancelling at this price.<br>I didn't buy the cradle but the USB-A (to USB-C) cable is more than adequate. I wear these most of the day and despite having a big head they sit relatively comfortably on the ear. There is a decent amount of padding around the cup and the man made fabric isn't sweaty!<br>I have Bluetooth'ed to both my mobile and laptop and have had ZERO connection issues, indeed I have used every comms app out there without issue (Mainly MS Teams). It switches app, picks-up, re-connects effortlessly.<br>I regularly wander off to make a brew or food during calls - just turn off the video, mute by moving the boom mic up and wander off to do whatever, jump back in at any time.

R2PHB1DTPBZIWS,Cogito Ergo Sum,06-May-21,TRUE,3,8,Audio cuts in/out during Teams call,"I bought the MS Teams certified version with USB-A dongle. Whenever I am in a Teams call, the audio pauses for a few seconds and I can't hear a thing the speaker says during that pause. The audio comes back on after a few seconds, but I have already missed bits of an important conversation. It is very annoying during interactive meetings. I have seen a few posts in different forums about the same issue. In the beginning I thought it could be due to firmware not being up to date and would sort itself out after a few rounds of updates. Within one month of use I have seen two rounds of firmware updates but the problem hasn't gone away. I then contacted Amazon customer service and they suggested me to reset the headset. Yes, resetting the device solved the problem, but only for a couple of days. They then suggested me to contact Jabra customer service. Jabra suggested me to reset both the device and the USB dongle. I did that but again the problem disappeared only for a day. They then suggested me to disable the ""USB selecting suspend setting"" in Advanced power setting option. But that didn't solve the problem. So, unfortunately, I had to return this otherwise excellent headset. I wonder if others faced the same problem.<br><br>Apart from the problem mentioned above, I also think there is a lag between audio and video when I watch Netflix or YouTube. Note that I also have Jabra 20 wired headset and that does not show any of the problems mentioned above.<br><br>The material used for ear pad does not seem made of very high quality stuff considering this is a £135 device.<br><br>The Jabra software is not up to the mark. I have two device connected - my PC and my android phone. I chose the option to not automatically answer any call in the phone when I am on another call on Teams in my PC. But it doesn't work. During important Teams call, if some spammer calls me on my mobile, it answers that one automatically suspending my Teams call at work. This is a very annoying thing and I couldn't get my head around this problem.<br><br>I am not an audiophile but to me sound quality seems excellent when I listen to music or watch a film. I also like the option to mute the microphone by pushing the boom upwards. I am not too bothered about noise cancelling feature since this is an on-ear headset not over-ear. The ability to listen to my own voice during conversation was nice. Although the accompanied SW allows user to control the amount of own voice being heard, I have not found it has any significant impact. Battery life is excellent. I can go through the whole week of extensive use without charging and still find about 10% battery life left.<br><br>Anyway, Jabra still need a lot of work to sort out the problems mentioned above.
