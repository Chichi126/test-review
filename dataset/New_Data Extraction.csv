RDRWOJET12LIC,"Extremely high quality cable. Bend points at either ends of cable well re-enforced and connectors themselves seem high quality and durable.Triggers super fast charging 2.0 on new Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra which is fairly uncommon for cables of this length and on newer phones.Highly recommend spending the money for a long lasting, high quality cable.",5,25/02/2025,United Kingdom
R1JLWICSZGFDML,"Excellent quality, speedy charging, does the job!Speedy delivery also",5,07/03/2025,United Kingdom
R16NIOTS0U6FCE,"Have you had cables that start to curl or twist?Yep, I suspect it's down to the cable diameter being too small to handle the current and overheating.Getting a power supply that can dish out high current will make that worse.So I have bought a couple of these, so that I shouldn't get issues.These are a bit more expensive but hopefully will never get an issue, these are designed to handle the current.I will update if I get any issues",5,27/02/2025,United Kingdom
RHJXUOEL3TA2C,"Pretty good, the cables are a lot flexible than I expected leading to me thinking they may not last.I haven't had an issue as of yet and are very good at fast charging so happy so far",4,24/12/2024,United Kingdom
R1CS5FNS3Q8N69,"This is the only cable that you need! I've tried a couple different cables and this cable has been the only one that is able to, one not break and get damaged at all. It's a good length and I don't struggle trying to use it with my configuration.  Overall it's functions well, it's compatible with all of my devices and it's good value for money. Highly recommend!",5,14/11/2024,United Kingdom

R102PULEX854IW,Bought this for my anker prime power bank to charge my phonePros:Looks and feels greatCons:This is not 1 metres it’s 0.9 metresBig and bulky which I don’t like.Conclusion£16 including discount not worth it if I’m being honest. Add £4 and buy the Apple Original one. It’s lighter and thinner. But if it’s for mac books or Samsung then it’s fine. Hope this helps,3,22/12/2024,United Kingdom
RIDX9IGYBFOEQ,Too expensive but if I don’t have to ever buy another one of these cables then I’ll be happy. Five stars for now but if it ever comes to pieces then considering the price it will get one star.,5,13/12/2024,United Kingdom

R2G4EQF0XQEMBA,"Anker Prime USB-C to USB-C Cable - it's good to know it can charge up to 240W but I don't have anything that charges this fast.In my test the highest I could charge was up to 100W.It is working well,  I love the nylon braided cable, this would last you for years .Compatible with any USB C capable device.I definitely recommend it!",5,15/08/2024,United Kingdom
R1SRN9UD9AX7W5,"This review is for a 240W USB-C to USB-C charge cable, branded Anker - a big name in USB chargers, cables and power banks.  It is presented in an attractive box which makes it ideal to give as a gift, but does seem to be slightly excessive packaging.Construction is excellent, with a durable braided card, aluminium shrouds at each end, and decent strain relief. It feels quality, and feels like it will last.  A rubber strap is included.Charging specs are impressive, claiming 240W.  I don't have anything that demanding, but did measure 95W charging a DJI Drone and 85W charging my Mac.Data speeds are less impressive, and appear to be USB2 only speeds.The charge rating is stamped on one of the shrouds, which is to be applauded, although I would have preferred to see it on both, along with the USB spec, ie USB2 in this case.Currently, it's just under £20, and for that I would have expected to see a fast USB3/4 cable.",4,11/08/2024,United Kingdom
R3PVO2B11F7PPF,This Anker cable is advertised as a 240W fast charging cable not a data cable so the fact it only supports 480Mbps (USB 2) data transfer rates is relatively irrelevant. It is still perfectly adequate for the odd bit of data transferring however if you specifically require a data cable then this isn’t for you. This cable is a little on the expensive side at £23 and as such a faster data cable - USB 3 or 4 - which also supports PD 240W is not much more expensive so you may decide that is a better option.The cable itself as you would expect from a brand like Anker is great quality and apparently made from more recycled materials which can only be a good thing.,4,13/08/2024,United Kingdom
R3MA66NRUV5DO6,"This single USB-C to USB-C fast charging cable by Anker arrived in a branded cardboard box neatly coiled up with an in-built rubber strap to keep the cable tidily together. I ordered this cable to charge my laptop (although bear in mind you need a suitable USB-C PD ported plug to fast charge with). The cable I ordered is 6ft in length which is a good length for my laptop, but it also comes in a 3ft length which may be more suitable for phones and tablets.I am using the cable with a GaN charger and I’m really pleased with its performance so far. The cable offers 240W charging meaning that it has the ability to power higher draw devices such up laptops as well as power banks, phones and tablets. It can also transfer data at up to 480Mbps, but bear in mind that this is quite slow by modern standards (USB 2.0 speed) and it is also worth noting that the cable does not support screen mirroring.The cable has a good flexibility with a grey / black, woven nylon braided finish made from recycled materials and it doesn’t tangle easily nor fray. The finish feels premium / durable and there is strain relief at the connection points. The cable has been tested to withstand 300000+ bends so I feel like I can have confidence in this product and it is pretty future proof in terms of charging capabilities.The fit of the connections into the ports is good without being too tight or loose and the connections appear to be good quality with the USB-C ends not having any seams (a good sign of a quality cable). Priced at £19.49 at the time of reviewing, I would say this is a good price for the excellent build quality of this cable particularly since it comes with a 2-year warranty included. I feel like if you look after the cable, it should last a good amount of time so I would be happy to recommend it.",5,13/09/2024,United Kingdom
R161N3VU2PAOIW,"This Anker ultra-durable, fast-charging USB-C to USB-C cable is built to last.The outer layer is made from 100% recycled materials making it environmentally sustainable and even the box is printed with soy milk.It has a lifetime warranty - rated to 300,000 bends (said to equate to 100-year bend durability).  The lifetime warranty lives up to the exceptional quality feel and look of this cable.It is also rated to 240W (which I can't verify).10/10 for styling and build quality.  However, I've dropped a star as at the current price of £22.99 (for the 6ft version) it seems unnecessarily expensive to me.4 stars.",4,13/08/2024,United Kingdom
R39O81NM4RW09L,"This Anker USB-C to USB-C Cable feels premium quality. Definitely, this product looks stronger than the average braided cables that you could get on the market. I already have previous experience with Anker products, so I’m not surprised about the good quality provided by this brand. This cable is sturdy but flexible. You could feel its premium quality. It works really well.",5,01/10/2024,United Kingdom
R27XKJ84OKMSVK,"This cable has impressed me with its durability and performance. Charging my devices is quicker, and it handles everything from my phone to my laptop without issues. The build quality feels solid, and the braided design adds extra toughness. Knowing it's made with upcycled materials is a nice touch. It's a reliable addition to my tech accessories that I use daily.",5,28/09/2024,United Kingdom
R1VRJB5K2XVO04,I received this product through the Amazon Vine programme and this review is based on my own opinions.This is a very high quality cable which has protection to allow use with smartphones and laptops. The connectors are excellent and the braiding and flex on the cable is fantastic. The cable also has a 24 month warranty for peace of mind and you'd expect from a brand like Anker. The only thing I struggle with a bit is the price of £19.99 especially when you can get the same spec cable from another good brand at £12.99 on Amazon right now. Other than that this is a great cable.,4,11/08/2024,United Kingdom
R2BABEAEZ7VU4G,"The Anker Prime USB C to USB C 240W cable is an excellent choice for anyone in need of a reliable, high-speed charging solution. From the moment you unbox it, you can tell that this cable is built to last. The eco-friendly materials used in its construction are a nice touch, reflecting Anker's commitment to sustainability without compromising on quality. The cable feels robust and well-made, giving you confidence that it will withstand daily wear and tear.One of the standout features of this cable is its e-marking with the Anker brand, which sets it apart from cheaper alternatives that lack a chip. This ensures that the cable supports 50V / 5A / 240W EPR, making it capable of handling high-power devices with ease. Whether you're charging a laptop, tablet, or smartphone, this cable performs exceptionally well, delivering fast and efficient power transfer. It's a reliable companion for both home and travel use, ensuring your devices are always ready to go.However, it's worth noting that the data transfer speeds are less impressive, capped at only USB 2.0. While this might be a drawback for those who need to transfer large files quickly, it doesn't detract from the cable's primary function as a high-speed charging solution. Overall, the Anker Prime USB C to USB C 240W cable is a solid investment for anyone looking for durability, reliability, and eco-friendly design in their charging accessories.",5,04/09/2024,United Kingdom
R7TRAINY2YAJ,"I’ve used many charging cables over the years, but this one is on another level. First off, it feels extremely durable. It’s been bent, stuffed in bags, and twisted with no signs of wear. Charging is fast and efficient, easily handling my phone and laptop without heating up. The length is just right for using on the sofa without feeling restricted. The recycled material aspect is also a nice touch for anyone conscious of sustainability. It's just a cable, but one that’s built to last and does its job efficiently.",5,19/09/2024,United Kingdom
R2YQAQEQG2UW1D,"Pros:This cable is a beast! It charges my OnePlus, iPad, and MacBook super fast, saving me so much time.It feels smart and eco-friendly because it's made from recycled materials. Besides, the braided design is tough and looks like it's going to last forever.It's just the right length; I can keep my devices nice and comfortable, even when the plug sockets far away, especially when working around rooms.OnePlus, iPad, or MacBook-they work just fine with this cable and with great quality each and every time.Verdict:Always trusted Anker, and this is no different. Never gotten a bad product from them! This fast charging is brilliant, from my OnePlus to MacBook; the braided design gives it some extra durability. It is a great length when one needs flexibility, and the quality is just as great as I have come to expect with Anker. If you're looking forward to reliable and well-made quality, then this cable will not disappoint you.",5,17/09/2024,United Kingdom
R3KOWW0DRYEZHZ,"Charging cables are not the most exciting things but very much a necessary part of modern life. This cable is really exceptionally good quality, with a thick braided cable and very sturdy metal and plastic fittings at either end. It comes ready with a cable tie attached so you can always easily roll it up to carry or store.Charging is genuinely fast (assuming you have a device that supports fast charging), and this despite the length of the cable. That length is so useful - especially for me, living in an older house in which the sockets are never quite where you would like them.I can't fault this cable. It is quite heavy, not necessarily ideal for shoving in a pocket or small bag; but its robustness would make it a great travel option if you have a suitcase to throw it in between stops. Five stars very easily for this item.",5,11/09/2024,United Kingdom
R1WA4DX7ZNWR2F,"I don't think this is a Data/Thunderbolt cable, nonetheless for the devices which support as much as 240W charging such as the newer MacBook Pros, some high end gaming laptops etc. Where portability and fast charging is required, this does the job.Of course you'd not want to keep this permanently charging for continuous AC use, though once reaching 100% this would trickle charge. So although the cable boasts the technology and durability to do so, I see this as more of an emergency charger for those on the go.As for regular indoo rcharging, most people are aware that rapid charging will typically reduce your batteries life and duration.So I'd use a default wattage charger typically, but it's useful to have one of these around when you cannot wait, and you need a full charge ASAP. Especially if it's a work laptop that you dont have to maintain.In typical Anker style, it comes in a lovely decorated and premium box, with great presentation. The nylon braided cable itself has the highest ot durability and stress testing standards, and the typical overheating, overcurrent and other circuitry protection. It also comes with a nice black rubber cable tie thats attached for easy and tidy storage. Of course there isn't any reason why this cannot charge other 65W, 100W devices, tablets or Smart Phones being backwards compatible charging them at their maximum rate with leftover, it could also be a power supply to various docking stations providing you have the plug, and not Thunderbolt bidirectional data transfer charging cables.But countless devices, docking stations and other computer related equipment require their own dedicated type C power input. I can't think of too many particular laptop models that require as much power as 240W but there are plenty of very high end modern Laptops that do, plus all of the mot modern and high end tablets no problem if it's power supply only.Perhaps a Thunderbolt 4 240W cable would have been versatile being able to do the same and more, but since I don't see any Thunderbolt 4 support, plus I think they would be significantly more expensive.For the very high quality, I think this 2M cable is appropriately priced at around £22. So i'll not be deducting any stars, i'd have liked perhaps some different colour braided options and styling on the casing maybe, but that's being fussy and quite subjective anyway. For the purpose they're intended I would recommend this product, from a highly reputable brand.",5,11/08/2024,United Kingdom
R2RJLBXHRNZ8KJ,"This is a USB-C to USB-C charging cable. I recently upgraded my phone and had to change the charging cables around my home.I have tried a lot of charging cables but Anker cables seem to have lasted the longest due to being well made. I really like that this cable has a cable tidy already attached as this is the first thing i add unless the cable is staying plugged in constantly.The cable comes well packaged in a nice box which was a first for me. The cable is thick and strong and the connectors are well made so i can see this cable lasting me many years.The cable is a good length for if i need it to reach far and with the cable tidy on it any excess can be neatly held in place. It supports fast charge which is a must these days with needing your phone all the time you're not without it long with this cable, fast charge plug needed.",5,18/09/2024,United Kingdom
R1SM8TFIE0K54O,"I am very pleased with this charging cable. It powers up my devices in no time and feels incredibly sturdy. The braided nylon construction prevents tangling and adds to its durability. The cable is also eco-friendly, which is a bonus. It’s compatible with all my gadgets, making it a versatile addition to my tech accessories.",5,30/08/2024,United Kingdom
RA92219N3S4T6,"Anker Prime USB-C to USB-C Cable, 240W 6 ft - ReviewThis cable is of amazing quality. Anker has been at the top when it comes to peripheral quality for many years now. This is no exception. This cable is part of Anker's new ""Prime"" line of products which includes the highest quality and innovative entries. This cable features a grey and black braided cable along with metal connector housing. The cable is flexible and feels robust. The cable has a high-end spec sheet, it supports up to 240W of power transfer. This makes it versatile and usable for charging all kinds of devices including laptops.For £22.99, at the time of review, this cable offers a very premium build and high-spec features. While this is pricey for a 6FT USB C cable, this is one of the best-quality cables I've reviewed. If you are looking for an ultra-premium cable this is a great option.",5,11/08/2024,United Kingdom
R1JFL9A6MEBTTL,"This review is based on my testing of the 6ft version of this cable.Anker's Prime Cable is high quality, as would be expected of Anker. The braided nylon material that sheaths the cable is 'upcycled' (does Anker mean 'recycled'?), and it is both robust and flexible.This cable offers fast charging up to a maximum of 240W, which will come in useful when I finally feel the urge to buy a suitable charger.There's no disputing that it is a great cable for fast charging compatible products. However, Anker has taken the inexplicable decision to limit the data throughput to a pathetic 480 Mbps – that's USB 2 speed. Why, Anker? Why?In conclusion, Anker's Prime Cable is very well made and is ideal for fast charging, but it's let down by the USB 2 speed.",3,10/08/2024,United Kingdom
R10T9MBQR38CYL,"Charges things perfectly, no issues. But not sure why it costs so much over other wires, the Anker brandname must cost a lot these days. Data wise, this is dreadful. Like, USB 2.0 speeds. It is not a data cable. Which, when you can get USB4 cables with 240W charging for around the same price, make some question what you are paying for here.It is a good charging cable, I get full speeds on my MacBook, iPad and various charging bricks. But it is just a cable, it does t feel any better than any others, it isn't any thinner, it is just a standard cable.The cable tie is nice though, can admit that. But nothing else is special about this cable. It is good, so you know, 5 stars, but it is literally as good as any other charging cable.",5,14/08/2024,United Kingdom
R1CJIFHY80YGKM,"This cable is a curious beast. Sheathed in a woven armor of recycled matter, it promises both utility and environmental consciousness. Its core, however, is where the true test lies. It is thicker than its more delicate brethren, a necessary sacrifice for the conveyance of such potent energy. This added bulk comes at a cost to flexibility, but it is a trade I am willing to make.The strain relief at its extremities is a welcome feature. Countless cables have met their demise at this vulnerable juncture. The Anker, however, shows no signs of weakness there. It feeds my Chromebook with vigor, a testament to its capacity. While I have yet to harness its full potential, as my charging equipment is of a more modest nature, it handles the current load with aplomb.It is a tool, pure and simple, designed for a specific purpose. It fulfills that role admirably.",5,14/08/2024,United Kingdom
R1KH7HR4LJQ2IN,"This cable is made really well, with solid plugs well bonded to the true nylon cable which feels like a premium quality. It looks and feels like it will withstand a good level of rough and tumble although I don’t plan on testing this out purposefully.The power rating states 240w which is a little more than I need as my USB-C kit only goes up to a maximum of 65w, which it handles fine. At least this cable will hopefully future-proof itself should power requirements of tomorrows kit have a wattage boost.£23 for this cable (at the time of my order) is a little steep in my opinion, given that there’s similar cables out there that will do the same thing for half the price. The length is good to connect my docking station to my MacBook Pro and all functions of the dock work just fine.I have many Anker branded cables and accessories and have never been disappointed on quality. This cable is no exception.",5,10/08/2024,United Kingdom
R3UGYJYGY7H5J4,"I do have quite a lot of USB C cables now, for various uses and in various places.This is by far the most premium out of all of them and now my favourite.The woven fabric coating is a lot softer to the touch, the cable bends as a cable should, others are very rigid and are hard to bend or wrap. The metal USB C plugs are solid and well made. Just everything about this cable feels better quality.Not forgetting to mention this is a fast charging cable capable of 240w, so this future proofs charging all your devices at optimum speeds.",5,13/08/2024,United Kingdom
R193A4TGXV50OG,"This ultra fast charging lead from Anker feels lovely. The braided cable is very soft and coils up really easily. It feels very resilient. I used it to charge my MacBook Pro which needs about 100 W of power and it did a good job. It’s a power only cable, not intended for data, which is fine by me. 6 foot (not quite 2m, which would have been much better) is a decent length.",5,13/08/2024,United Kingdom
R2E2BWE4IBOZ95,"A superb, high quality USB-C to USB-C cable that supports ultra fast charging. Exactly what I would expect of Anker cables having used them for some time now. The braided nylon cord ensure the cable won't easily break from bending at the charging port. They quote that the cable is good for 300,000 bends. You can buy cheaper cables but, usually, with a big down turn in quality.",5,11/08/2024,United Kingdom
R2VJSABZ8RA2I,"Anker make great stuff. Their portable bluetooth speakers are an essential for when I'm having a bath, so it's no surprise that they cope just fine with a USB cable. It's braided, flexible, and works at full-speed for rapidly charging my phone and tablet. Comes with nice packaging too, in its own fancy box. It's pretty expensive, but if you need a solid, reliable cable, then this will do the job.",5,11/08/2024,United Kingdom
R2161ZEUST86Y3,This is  USB Type C to USB Type C PD charging cable. It comes with Anker quality and super high (240W) power support. Works very well. Looks highly durable and sturdy. Loved it and can easily recommend.Note that this is a Vine review for the item sent for free to review. Please do your own research and judgement on the price.,5,14/08/2024,United Kingdom
RRIQYPNAMIFDL,"Nice soft flexible braided cable with good strain relief. Feels very high quality.I can get fast charging from this cable, and I can tidy it away neatly with the included cable tie.",5,18/08/2024,United Kingdom
R21EOZJP3OD7SU,I can never seem to have enough USB cables these days and where possible always try to buy Anker products as I find them really well made and reliable.I ordered the 6 foot cable and it's really well made and comes in a nice box. The braiding on the cable is nicely done and it feels like it will last a long time. I've not got anything over 100w but the cable has worked perfectly with everything I've used it with.,5,13/08/2024,United Kingdom
R3KT571EHVOSZK,"This is a good quality USB cable, with a nice braid and it comes with a little rubber strap to help coil it up.It supports 240 watt charging which is great, that's the top spec for USB at the moment.The data rate though is at USB 2.0 levels so it's basically useless for anything but charging. That's 480 Mbps as opposed to the top USB 3.2 spec of 40 Gbps.Given that this is one of the most expensive USB cables I've seen recently, I don't know why they'd bother making it at all. It makes sense to offer higher power, low data rate cables that are cheaper than their high power high data rate cousins. It does not make sense to offer cables that are more expensive than most that meet the highest USB 4 specification, yet offer no advantages.It's no wonder they've only printed the power rating on this cables connectors, and not the data rating. My policy is that I deduct a star if both aren't printed. The overwhelming majority of cables I've had in the last year have both printed on them, it's not hard at all, and it's crucial so that we can easily identify the appropriate cable in our tech pouch. We don't want our charging or our data transfer rate limited by the simple fact that we used the wrong cable because there's no way to memorise all your cables if you're a normal human being. Not only should this cable not exist at this price and lack of functionality, it isn't even properly labelled.Anker can do a lot better as a brand, I've had plenty of products from them that were fairly priced, and properly made to modern standards. All you can say that's positive about this cable it's it's physically well constructed and can supply a lot of power. Which is not enough to justify it existing at all, let alone the price. I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed.*I will also add that this came in a box, which is all cardboard but still, is an absolute waste of packaging. It's made to be hung up in a shop. Fair enough, maybe do that version. But why not ship it without to people buying online? It's just manufactured waste that has to be recycled.*Also, I am genuinely angry, I was just being humorous. This sort of stuff really frustrates me because they can do better and there's zero reason not to.",2,12/08/2024,United Kingdom
R3139ZRDXD5J3T,"In terms of quality, this cable feels really nice. The braided design is flexible and feels great to the touch, but the most important aspect is that it's a high-powered cable, rated at 240 watts. My Motorola phone confirms that it’s charging in rapid mode, and that’s all that matters to me. I hope it lives up to my expectations in terms of jhow long it is going to last—if not, I’ll update my review accordingly.",5,10/08/2024,United Kingdom
RBSNTSX0U152G,This is a premium quality cable. Its brilliant and supports fast charging up to 240W.Excellent braided cable that's very flexible.The cable has secure connectors that fit snugly into USB-C ports.Comes with a useful stretchy silicone strap for holding it together when coiled up for storage.,5,10/08/2024,United Kingdom
R35HCNG4URNTS5,"This Anker Prime Cable is an excellent choice if you need a reliable, high-speed charging solution. It’s built to last, performs exceptionally well, and the eco-friendly materials are a nice touch. Unlike other cables, it has a nice weight to it so it not only performs as a premium product but also feels like one.The upcycled-braided nylon feels incredibly sturdy, yet flexible. It’s obvious that this cable is designed to last. The material doesn’t tangle easily, and it seems like it will hold up well even with heavy use.My laptop has a maximum charging speed of 100w, so this cable is more than capable of delivering that and will be future proof should I purchase devices which need upto 240w of power.Cable is e-Marked with Anker as the vendor and supports 50V / 5A / 240W EPR. Cable data transfer speed is USB 2.0. The packaging is sleek and well-designed, giving a nice first impression and would make an ideal gift!Bought primarily to use as a laptop charging cable. Very happy!",5,08/08/2024,United Kingdom
R2MVZVVJMHKQQ1,"I absolutely love the ghd straighteners. The heat settings are perfect, providing just the right amount of heat to straighten and style without causing any extreme heat damage. It works wonderfully to create sleek, smooth, and soft hair with an impressive shine, just like you’d get from a professional salon.I purchased this after retiring my old straightener, which lasted over 10 years, and  upgrading to GHD is a game changer!

R2LW512ZU819ED,Comparing these ghd to the divabrand of straighteners.  These ghd ones are very basic straighteners in comparison to the diva ones i had.  With the diva ones I had i could set the temperature to what I wanted and it also had a clip at the end to close them when not in use.  The hot plate although adequate on these ghds and does the job I intended to use them for and are good at curling.  The hot plates are shorter in length in comparison to the diva ones I had which means I can't put as much hair in and that means It takes me longer to do my hair cos my hair is thick.  they do look sturdy and dont feel heavy to hold while doing my hair but Over all i think i would have bought the diva ones again if I had to chose again.,5,25/11/2024,United Kingdom

RKU55K8PGUK4K,Brought these ghd straighteners at end of November but only decided to use today 15/2/25 no instructions in box so assumed you just plugged in socket like my old ghd straighteners - white light comes on and immediately goes off no heat!! Played around for awhile but no luck.Went on Amazon site to my orders and thank goodness you can get instructions on how to set up - which was to press button where white light appeared - you may think this was an obvious thing to do but I was going on my previous ghd straighteners where you just plugged in red light comes on plus heat!!,5,15/02/2025,United Kingdom

R18G4X8IK9IW9X,"Having had my previous GHD straightener for the best part of 10 years, I decided it was time to get a new one and having always trusted the brand previously I thought I'd be safe to go for something similar again. Sadly it seems that the quality has greatly decreased in that time. The straightener's feel quite flimsy in comparison to their predecessor. As someone with quite fine hair I was disappointed that on first use the plates do not seem to meet fully and it seemed to take more effort to get the straightening that I have been used to. Honestly probably wouldn't recommend these, which is sad as GHD seem to be operating on a previously gained great reputation while now not offering the same quality product.",3,26/11/2024,United Kingdom

I love the little sound effect it makes when it heats up and when turning it off—it’s a nice touch! It feels like an upgrade, delivering smooth, sleek results faster than my Babyliss.

Misses was over the moon so I'm in the good books for five minutes. She thought that they were broken at first as her old set had a flip switch to turn them on but these have a more modern light up press switch. As soon as I showed her they'd upgraded in the last ten years she was fine. I know nothing about hair straighteners but the misses assures me that I made the right choice as she loves them (she still won't throw the old set away, so the old ones just sit in a drawer.

I tend to go for the top range of things in general, but considering the price difference I didn’t and I’m really pleased I got this one. She abs loves it and it’s so striking how different her hair is after using these originals.

RV8N98YLWQTXJ,"I wanted an open ear design as I find having something stuck in my ears whilst exercising becomes uncomfortable. Naturally I was drawn to the Bose Open Ultra clip-on earbud, but I could not justify the £250 to £299 cost for running on the treadmill or around the park.  And let’s be honest do we really need an audiophile quality sound when sweating and dodging others whilst out running?As a brand I love Anker and have a number of their power solutions - they justifiably have a great reputation in this area, but I was still somewhat dubious about a pair of £45 clip on open earbuds.  I thought they would be tinning and disappointing.  Having worn my newly acquired ones over the last few days I can report that I find them pretty comfortable and have a pretty impressive sound quality.  Even when load enough to hear them over the TV (when my wife is watching) they do not leak significant sound.  The standard EQ is OK, but I still downloaded the app onto my iPhone and tried the other options.  To me the Bass present sounds awful (flat), I agree with other reviewers who say the spacial audio/surround is rather disappointing and that was true for the vast majority of music from most of my streaming sources I use.  There are some tracks that do sound pretty ok.  But again, this is not really the purpose of these buds (I am also in love with my Sonos Era 300, so these are never going to stand up to muster).  That said if you spend even a few moments with the custom options and set an EQ profile that suits your taste you will find these little bits of clip on plastic more than capable of sounding nice whilst exercising.Reviewer also mention that they are poor for call quality - again not really surprising when you consider the design and their intended purpose.Would I recommend these? If you have no financial limits and you want to sit in quiet environments, I would hazard the Bose are better, but for exercising with I can't imagine they are 5 times the price better.Anker/Soundcore have done it again. They have built a good (not super premium) quality product and brought it to market at a price that delivers pragmatically pleasing results at a sensible price - thanks Anker.A last point - the case is a little naff, serviceable and functional but does let the overall package down.  I do not need or even really want wireless charging, but the case does feel like it is - plastic.",5,03/09/2024,United Kingdom
R3G6NNYCWZK8XR,"I so wanted to love these earbuds for the following reasons1.  They sound great for non-invasive earbuds.  Lovely rich sound.2.  They look cool!  I got them in the pearl colour and they look great in the ears.3.  Great price for quality of them.However, for me, only one ear was comfortable.  The left ear - no problem... no pressure and so very comfy.  The right ear - oooof....it squeezed right from the start and the pressure and pain got worse the longer I wore them.I guess I have odd ears.  I also guess, these will fit some, and not others.I hope they fit you, for the 3 reasons above.",4,14/11/2024,United Kingdom
R2OVD9W0XXMWT7,"Got this as present for my husband, he’s very pleased with them. I was kind of worried as he is particular when it comes to earphones and headphones.There are three different plastic cup sizes to fit ears, they remained unmoved while working out. Super comfortable, usually forgets he has them on! Battery lasts a long time too.Easy to operate and fit in, excellent quality and sound! Audio can be customised via Soundcore App. Touch controls are very responsive andPractical.Outstanding value for money, totally recommend",5,04/01/2025,United Kingdom
RZCWO32KQ8EZQ,"Liked the interesting design and when trying them around the house after some adjustment they stopped pinching my love and were pretty comfortable, when you get it right the sounds not bad too.The first time I used them in the Gym the sucked up sweat from my ears and the right hand one was all misted inside. It never worked again, couldn’t charge or switch on. They claim they are IPX4 water resistant but i found them as waterproof as toilet paper.",1,23/03/2025,United Kingdom
R3PO7MJ2UCVFEH,"For C30i open ear buds.  I cannot wear Inner ear buds, as they don't fit in my ear canal. This cuff design is very comfortable, and I use the largest ear grip.

Would definitely recommend, and for the price a no brainer.",5,06/03/2025,United Kingdom
R21PTFZGNFZET1,"I’ve always had a positive experience with Anker products, but these open-ear buds didn’t fully live up to my expectations. Here’s my detailed breakdown:Pros: • Build Quality: Solid construction, as you’d expect from Anker. The product feels durable and well-made, appropriate for its price range. • Connectivity: Stable connection without drops during use. However, the range isn’t as strong as some competitors like AirPods – once you have a few walls between you, they lose connection. • Charging Speed: The charging time was quick, which is a plus if you’re always on the go.Cons: • Fit: Unfortunately, the fit wasn’t as comfortable as I hoped. After about an hour of wear, my ears started to hurt, and even after taking them off, the discomfort lingered. • Sound Quality: The sound quality was disappointing. It felt finicky, requiring the perfect angle to hit the ear canal, and didn’t compare well to other open-ear devices like Meta glasses. • Functionality: The haptic button behind the ear was awkward to use and often didn’t respond properly. I would have preferred a tap-anywhere function like the first-gen AirPods. • Volume and Conversations: When the volume is high, it’s difficult to have a conversation without taking them off or pausing the music entirely.Value for Money:While these buds are built well and have fast charging, the poor sound quality and uncomfortable fit make it hard to justify the price. With a few improvements, they could be a good value, but in their current state, they fall short.",3,13/10/2024,United Kingdom
R23SM3GRQ7PX4D,"Sure the sound isn’t as you’d expect from buds which are inserted, but I love them when out and about. Feels safe to be able to hear what’s also going on around me and listen to music.

R2HO9MFV55ZJIZ,"The sound from the earbuds was good, as I have always found with Anker products however I found them difficult to fit and painful when worn for just a short period of time.  I tried to ease them off slightly by heating them gently and bending them (as you would with the legs of eye glasses) this improved the fit but neither earbud would charge following this procedure.I take the blame for this and the only reason for mentioning it in the review is to advise others not to try the same thing.As for the fit of the headphones they are not for me but others may find them fine.I have since purchased Anker Soundcore V20i open earbuds which I find to be a very comfortable alternative.",3,21/03/2025,United Kingdom
R1LRFTOKKSS2KK,"I've been looking for some open earbuds for a while now as I wanted something for listening to podcasts while both working and walking outside.I didn't really want to pay the £300 for a pair of Bose (I have both Bose Quiet Comfort buds and 700 Headphones and I honestly don't think they are worth the money) and as I already have many sets of SoundCore earbuds and headphones I thought I would give these a try.Firstly, the sound quality is great for listening to Podcasts, Audio Books etc. I While they also sound good for certain types of music, for others not so much (for example Rock doesn't sound good).When using them for calls/online meetings I have found them very good.  Being open, you can hear your environment (and yourself) so you don't end up talking too loudly or quietly.  The sound quality from the microphones is very clear.Battery life is great, you certainly get several hours from a charge, I don't know how long the total battery life is yet as I haven't needed to charge the case yet.I find the touch controls a little fiddly.  They are at the rear of the buds, so you have to hook your finger around the back of the bud to use the limited controls (basically just tap once, twice or hold).Finally the biggest issue for me is the fit and comfort.  I guess this will be different for everyone, but for me they become uncomfortable after around 30 minutes of wear time.  They seem to just push into my ear cartilage a little too  hard, so after a while they just hurt. I've tried wearing them at different points on my ear and they just aren't comfortable for long term wearing.  I do find if I wear them a little higher up my ear they are better, but then this has a negative impact on the sound quality.If these were more comfortable to wear then they would be nearly perfect, but they are not quite there for me.",4,09/09/2024,United Kingdom
R1Y8XDKL3USPRV,"I bought these a while ago after being advised not to wear in-ear earbuds anymore. At first, I was a little sceptical about how well they would work given that they clip onto the ear, which seemed like poor placement. However, having tried them for a few months now, I've actually been impressed at both the quality and loudness of the sound without too much noise-leakage. They don't provide any kind of noise cancelling, so they aren't perfect for listening to podcasts and audiobooks on busy roads or in very crowded areas, but they've been perfect for casual music listening.The only real issues I've had with them are around the design.First, they do have some touch features on the back of each ear bud, which are great - play/pause by tapping, skipping forwards/backwards with double taps, and volume up and down when holding a finger to the touch sensor. The only issue I've really had with these is the earbud registering touches on my neck when moving my head around and pausing my music, but these features can be turned off so it's not a massive issue.Second, due to the rigid nature of the design, they have started to hurt my ears when wearing for prolonged periods of time. For shorter periods, they've been great, but the lack of flexible bridge between the sound driver in the ear and the touch pad behind the ear leads to a bit more clamping than is entirely comfortable.",3,29/12/2024,United Kingdom
R1HXOFTXCCX230,A little tight to being with but definitely worth their cost.I would say don't expect them to be competitive with something that with over £100 but for their cost they are definitely a four stars.,4,05/02/2025,United Kingdom
R2TD9Y8XC7T6T6,"I also have the Bose ultra open and the Huawei freeclips, which also fit onto the antihelix part of the ear.Firstly, the soundcore sound decent for the money and have the largest diaphragm, however they are the quietest and have the least dynamic range. They do, however have very good openness, probably on a par with the Huawei, but bigger and deeper than the Bose.The main issue for me is comfort. The soundcore come with some hard plastic clips to make the gap smaller. This doesn't work as the buds are completely hard plastic and the buds always feel like they are pinching, they also gradually slide down the ear until they have to be adjusted. They are by far the most uncomfortable of the 3 and the most uncomfortable earphones I have tried. The touch controls work ok, but can be temperamental and need to be touched in exactly the right place.The Huawei is vastly more comfortable, but does move around on the ear slightly more, the sound however is as wide, but with vastly better imaging and range. They are also the loudest of all 3. The Huawei also works the best in terms of touch controls and feels the best made by a longway. They also switch ears automatically if you swap them, so no dedicated left and right, they also have tap control instead of touch so simply touching them won't change tracks, they need a tap, this works so well I can change tracks/pause etc by tapping my face Infront of the earphones (volume control is turned on in the app and is off by default, but works by tapping and holding) and they have the best mic as they use bone conducting. The Bose and soundcore don't come close the the mic quality.The Bose is the most comfortable, but does sit lower (The buds can be positioned anywhere on the antihelix, but for me between the antihelix and earlobe feels great and sounds the best in terms of hifi sound. The Bose are the warmest sound but are also quite narrow sounding when compared to the other 2. They are however wider sounding than the Bose QC ultra. In fact, the over all sound is better than the QC ultras and is closer to my B&O EX earbuds but lacking the bdeep bass, the Bose do have bass but it's not as forward and they are miles behind the B&O H95 though, but those are headphones. The touch controls are simple buttons, but they control everything, including volume and work flawlessly.All 3 of these open earbuds though, sound vastly better than the shokz open run, or open run pros (I only have the pros now, which are better than the non pro version. However, I truly hate them as they give me massive pain where they sit just Infront of the ear and they sound horrendous.",2,24/12/2024,United Kingdom
R32J19G1OGTS8I,"These are fantastic—extremely comfortable and particularly helpful when I'm dealing with tinnitus. Unlike some other reviewers, I haven't experienced issues with them randomly pausing due to contact with the back of my neck or head during movement. The companion app allows you to customize settings, such as adjusting how presses on the earphones control volume, which is a great feature. However, I've noticed the app occasionally resets, requiring me to reconfigure the settings. Despite this minor inconvenience, I really like these, especially considering their price point compared to competitors!",4,25/12/2024,United Kingdom

R36JTTMA64JVKE,"I really like these headphones.They fit lovely and I have really small ears, the quality is good and I like that you can update the setting via the app.. they set up straight away and comes with everything you need.Good for value for money and perfect for me when I want to work with headphones in but still hear my surroundings. I haven’t tried them at the gym which is also why I got them but they feel secure on :)",5,20/02/2025,United Kingdom
R2RZKUL9RD4MU9,"I have a whole lot of earbuds from Sony, Jabra, Bose and Anker. But this was my 1st clip-on earbuds and its pretty amazing. I dont even feel I'm wearing it and I've listened to songs and watched a movie for over 5 hours and still don't feel a thing! I've never felt so with earbuds, over the ear headphones, neck band speakers, etc.So I'll rate it as follows1. Ability to wear for long - 9.52. Sound Quality -  6.0 (Lacks the bass punch as it's open ear... duh)3. Fit - 9.0 (Doesn't budge unless you do Raygun moves)4. Controls - 5.0 (Can't control volume + touch controls aren't rlly great)5. Battery Life - 8.0 It'll get you through Bur there are other ones that'll last longer.6. Compact Size - 8.5 ( Isn't the smallest but fits in ur pocket without looking like ur carrying a dildo)7. Value for Money - 8.0 ( Decent. If ur gonna watch 5 episodes or 2 movies get this. If u wanna game, look away. Punchy music? No way.",4,03/09/2024,United Kingdom

R2LUVK9AJ0Y8ZW,"These headphones are surprisingly good! I was very sceptical how they would sound and how they would fit, but I am impressed how good they are on both fronts.Is the sound quality as good as in-ear buds - no. They never will be nor are they supposed to be. They are built for a different purpose! Can I wear them around the house/garden doing chores or outside and still hear my surroundings - yes. That’s exactly what I bought them for. Best suited to audiobooks or podcasts over music but the latter is still ok.Bonus is that I can wear them with glasses/sunglasses without an over-ear loop getting in the way. Plus I can wear them with my shoulder-length hair down or in a bun without dislodging them.",5,20/01/2025,United Kingdom
R3MP0S463VN4FZ,These are amazing for the price point.There fit is really determined on your ear shape though so you may be disappointed.I found one ear was perfect and the other is just too big and it is painful to wear.I have tried the bone conduction types and find these alot better.,4,27/11/2024,United Kingdom
R2ZO2DJ8C3D9WI,"The stars on these may go up over time, but after nearly a months use, I’m at about 3 star rating. Bought these to wear on my walk to and from work and when hiking. They’re great as I can hear what’s going on around me and still be immersion my podcasts. I’m even able to wear them while working and not ignore my coworkers.It feels like the battery last forever, and they charge really quickly. For someone who’s always worn overear headphones because I couldn’t get a good fit out of anything else, these fit great and with the added bonus of grips, you’ll find what suits you.The reason for knocking two stars off is because of the touch controls. There seems to be absolutely no sense to them. They work when not needed and don’t when are. And don’t do what you thought they would. It is a bit annoying to always need my phone in reach to pause.",3,03/11/2024,United Kingdom
R31XITAOWRT9VM,These are great! They are so tiny and lightweight you hardly know you are wearing them. The sound quality is excellent,5,25/02/2025,United Kingdom
RQOHETSZDBFWF,"Bought these because I have a new daith piercing and, being that they don’t sit inside the ear, they wouldn’t irritate or cause the discomfort that my regular in-ear ear buds now would/do. In terms of comfort these fit my right ear more comfortably (a bit ‘pinchy’) than my left but that might be more due to my ears rather than the buds themselves.The problem, however, was that having had these a couple of weeks, both sides have only worked simultaneously once, despite resetting them and re-pairing them a number of times. Usually only one or other side works and having contacted soundcore, it appears that they are indeed faulty out of the box. I’ll order these again (even though they are more expensive than they were on Black Friday and there is no way to just exchange them) in the hope that this was just a one-off as I have usually had a good experience with anker and soundcore before and my old ones still sound amazing years later (if only I could wear them now!). One star because they don’t work and have caused two, second star because I still have some faith in the brand.",2,06/01/2025,United Kingdom

R3L2UFXQLTZC5G,"Obviously these depend heavily on your ear and its shape. Don't expect perfect stereo sound if you have one ear or your deaf or you using these in a noisy environment.  If you have cauliflower ears, these might not fit or be uncomfortable.They don't go in your ear hole, rather floats  over it, so there is sound that can disturb others close to you. Personally I find they grip well to my ear and don't move. Yes it's an odd feeling and yes you might find after a while they become uncomfortable, but they are more comfortable than other alternatives I've used. For the price, you can give them a go, but maybe try and borrow a set first and see if your ears are the right shape. Don't worry about the slightly shiny plastic case, there are plenty of soft silicone protective covers you can buy separately.",5,24/10/2024,United Kingdom

R38ILZ01O7NNQW,"Overall great earphones, but others have done much better reviews on that already. The info I'm always looking for on new earphones is whether they will fit around my ear piercings. I've got two lobe piercings, a tragus and a daith. I don't think I'd want to wear these ear buds next to new piercings because they rest slightly on the daith ring and they need careful positioning to keep them clear of the flat back of the tragus. But these piercings are a couple of years old and well healed, the earbuds are comfortable slotted in behind the piercings and I think will be totally fine.

Nothing is invincible! Let’s just all agree on that.This doesn’t bother me if the company recognises this and deals with it under warranty correctly.And they DID!! I noticed a slight rusty sound coming through when on the phone started to develop. Annoying for people I was calling. I messaged the company and they sent out a brand new pair no quibble immediately! I don’t even need to return anything to them!Customer service win!!I’m impressed!!

R2932KSRPI2WKX,"I bought a set of reconditioned C30i earbuds and have been very happy with them since day one.The battery life is excellent and the sound quality is clear and punchy - remember that these are an open-ear design; therefore, you will be able to hear external noise which will compromise what you're listening to, but this is by design.I have these to replace my version 1 Apple AirPods and what I miss in functionality is made up for by build quality, comfort and volume.  I'm certain that they won't fit everyone's ears, but they come with different-sized ear grips to help with this.  The build quality of the buds and battery case is solid as I would expect from Anker/Soundcore.I have yet to make the control button work reliably (hence the 4 star and not 5) but it's certainly not a deal breaker as I'm more than happy to use the controls on my phone.I want to try to dispel any fears people have with customer support from Anker/Soundcore (there's a 1-star review from someone who states that they stopped working after a week).  I have bought a lot of Anker/Soundcore products over the past 10 years and on a few occasions have had problems and on every occasion they were resolved with minimal fuss by their customer support (each item was replaced in days).Another thing to be aware of is price fluctuations with Anker/Soundcore as they very regularly reduce their prices so check before you buy using a price tracker website.",4,05/12/2024,United Kingdom

R1IUYL2MFJCT53,"I’ve wanted some open earbuds for a while now - for cycling and to prevent a repeat of ear infections due to impacted wax. I was just winding up to buy some Bose ones when I saw a colleague at work wearing these. Asked him if I could have a go and was genuinely shocked at how competent the sound quality is, especially at this price. They can get very loud and the (surprisingly excellent) phone app lets you customise the EQ very quickly and easily. The bass is never going to feel deep but it is surprisingly punchy and rich for an open device, and it’s perfectly good for casual listening, especially rock music. (Any more and I’d suggest it would negate the point of open ear buds).Did a call test with my wife. Could hear her loud and very clearly. She said the mics rustle a little when I move but aside from that they were fine; she had no problem hearing me. (That said I was in a quiet room, not a busy city street or building site).Contrary to others, I find the touch controls to be very easy to use: touch your index finger on the front part of the earbud (near your ear canal) to ‘anchor’ it and then use your thumb to tap the rear of the earbud (where the sensor is) it works perfectly. (The index finger helps to guide your thumb to the right place and apply some pinch pressure). I think the sensitivity is just right to prevent accidentally triggering the controls when moving the earbuds.A bonus is you can use the phone app to customise the controls, and even lock them.The phone app itself has a few additional use features (battery monitoring for each earbud AND the case!), various white/ambient noise generators for focusing on work etc.  It’s solid, fully featured and very easy to use. It does ask you to create a login account but allows you to skip this step if you don’t care about backing up your settings to the cloud.I’ve been wearing mine solidly for 6 hours now and can barely tell they’re in place, even though they’re very securely fitted (no chance of falling off). No fitting adapters needed for me.=== UPDATE ===I *have* experienced discomfort wearing these on one of my ears for a couple hours today (but the other ear was ok). Soreness has gone within minutes of taking them off. It seems like I was wearing it too low down and it was putting pressure on the bit of cartilage that protrudes just above my ear lobe. So if that’s you, try wearing it higher up your ear.To be honest, my biggest worry now is how many charge cycles the tiny earbud batteries will take before they become useless. Will I be able to buy new versions of these buds in the future if needed? I hope so!",5,06/12/2024,United Kingdom

The design is sturdy and although it is fairly heavy it doesnt take up too much space in your bag.The variety of adapters included is great if you are visiting places that have varied outlet requirements. A big positive is the 2-prong adapter sticks far enough out to reach into outlets that have a depression in them. Other adapters I have had dont reach in far enough so it can be quite annoying. All the adapters have a nice slide to them and didnt get stuck or jammed once.It doesnt get too hot either and the 4 USB ports mean that lots can be charged at once. I managed to charge an electric shaver, 2 phones and a powerbank at the same time, perfect for when a hotel only has limited outlets available.Very good price and excellent performance, I highly recommend.",5,20/05/2024,United Kingdom
R1OMMSICY0EAZR,"The adapter is a bit weighty, but no issues.Pity though it did not come with a travel bag at this price point.It is approx 2"" wide on each side and 2 .25"" tall approx.It covers most of the known world and looks well built.Have tested all its functions out using the UK adapter and it works very well.No issues with charging my iPhone or Mac.It describes the charging arrangements on the plug, so you know what's what.It is fused so that gives a level of protection, just have to remember to carry spare fuse with me, though it does contain a spare, just above the fuse holder, nice.",4,18/01/2025,United Kingdom
R2JRH90BVS46BB,"Where have I been!? My sister recommended this to me and it's invaluable. I take it everywhere with me, not just for travelling, but use it every day at home due to the multiple USB ports. I charge everything I can on it. Now that manufacturers are using USB-C to charging point I would likely upgrade to the version that has a USB-C port aswell, but for now this works perfectly and is used excessively!",5,16/10/2024,United Kingdom

R2HNAFDFJGC34I,It’s great to take on holiday as it fits most sockets and it’s easy to change from one type to another,5,28/01/2025,United Kingdom
R2ZFXTMIDCNKEM,It's well made and worked fine until Nepal came up on its itinerary. Then I found that India etc. are 'round pin' countries so it's hardly 'worldwide'. If your travels are all in 'flat pin' lands then it's fine.,3,18/01/2025,United Kingdom

R323CYQP1BW35D,As an adapter,4,19/01/2025,United Kingdom
R27TW7G5P5D218,Works well. Having four USB outlets is more than enough to simultaneously charge all our security sensitive devices (phones etc.) that we would not want to plug in to the USB outlets provided in hotels.The mains power outlet is fuse protected and also has a big enough power rating to run a hair dryer or curling tongs.All in all a good product. The only thing missing really is transient suppression. It may have that but it’s not stated in the description.,4,08/11/2024,United Kingdom
R2VE474W1M060V,Have used this on 3 holidays so far and also used it when staying at my friends place. So far so good works well and handy to change two things at the same time. I'll be bringing it to Australia with on my next trip so I hope it work aswell as it has done so far.,5,22/01/2025,United Kingdom
R1ZPILK7G70FYC,"A most helpful gadget for travel and seems to be good quality. No need to take multiple adapters now.

Once you get the plug inside (there was quite some resistance when plugging in the laptop) it works flawlessly and we call get to charge our devices while the computer is also running :)Very versatile with all the different options, perfect for travel, whether it be work or leisure :)",4,26/09/2024,United Kingdom
R3VGPA33S5MMDK,Good price and works well.  I bought it for a trip to Japan which uses USA 2-pin sockets. The only caution I have is that the unit was a loose fit in the socket.  I am not sure if that was caused by the unit or the socket.  The weight of the unit caused it to angle out slightly and I was concerned that it fell out.  But it didn't and everything was okay.  So just bear that in mind. All in all a goodbye at a good price and it worked.,5,07/12/2024,United Kingdom

I know we've all been there.Soemthing about having just one adapter that fits everything really makes my brain tick, and now I just keep this in my suitcase for every time I travel and makes everything so much easier.It's also built sturdily, so you don't need to worry about it breaking halfway through your trip or when the luggage handlers throw your stuff about.Also a huge bonus for me is the USB extensions also, which makes things even more efficient.",5,05/10/2024,United Kingdom

ROA7DZT69Q7QW,"This is a great product for what it is... It converts the plug shape/size to fit the electrical outlets of different countries.However, and this is IMPORTANT, it DOES NOT convert the voltage. So, if you have a device that uses only 110V AC, it will blow the fuse, or destroy the device if you plug the adapter into a 240V AC and plug the device into the adapter. To convert the voltage you will still need a voltage converter. Most people buying a ""travel adapter"" are probably looking for a ""voltage converter"" that comes with multiple plug adapters. If that's the case, this is not what you are looking for! Look at the photos to see what you'll probably need to get from a UK 240V AC socket to a USA 110V AC socket!If you have devices which can work with both 110V AC and 240V AC, then this adapter is all you need.",3,14/09/2024,United Kingdom

R3ED8HP8DY5LQP,I assumed this would work in the UK for two pin adapters for shavers and electric toothbrushes but unfortunately not. However it has been absolutely fantastic for our holiday to Spain and reduced the amount of plugs and adaptors we need to take. I especially like the fact that the pins retract making it even easier to travel with. Great quality too!,4,06/08/2024,United Kingdom
RIR1302TTUT9I,I have used this on so many holidays in several counties. Highly recommend this adaptor! The ports are great and it packs away easily.,5,28/12/2024,United Kingdom

Went to amazon.co.uk and had this Tessan Plug Adapter delivered to the first place that we were staying for more than one night. UK is smaller than US (where we live), so the couple of things that I needed were delivered the next day, reliably and on-time! The adapter was perfect and allowed for one item to be plugged into the wall, while simultaneously charging up to four other USB devices (phone, headphones, 2 portable chargers). Cannot beat this for the price, so if you need one, this is it!",5,08/08/2024,United Kingdom
R1LJGPWZ1QR2GN,I buy a lot of tat before I go on trips. A lot of it breaks or doesn’t get used. This gem is coming everywhere with me. Can use it for any plug and has 4 USB ports so you can charge everything at the same time from one socket.,5,01/11/2024,United Kingdom
R2ZISRS3AWYL9D,We arrived in London from the US and our adapter stopped working so this adapter was perfect! The only thing that would make it better is if it had the ability to insert normal plug ends into it not just USB.,4,27/07/2024,United Kingdom

R2B64SU28XY55U,Bought two of these for myself and daughter to charge devices with on a trip to Japan. Liked the fact that I could use it as a UK charger at the hotel by Heathrow for an early flight as well as in Japan. The fact that it also doubles as an A/C socket that I could use to charge the toothbrush as well as the four USB charging points was a bonus.

R3F7Q8WJBYRL3O,"It's a very good adaptor, very sturdy and can be used in many different countries which is a bonus for someone that travels very frequently.But inserting a plug within the adaptor is hefty ...

R36QKGG19AGTCU,"This is quite a clever design and covers just about every common conversion, although perhaps a little bulky if just want one country conversion.The additional 4 USB charging sockets are a useful addition,  although unfortunately no 'c' type., so will need a converter cable (A to C)  for most modern phones.Would I buy again - Yes",5,24/08/2024,United Kingdom
R33E5LV43XLD78,"It's ok, it works... However the bulky design means it's always half falling out of the socket and any contact or a slight tug on a usb cable and it falls out.

RKQ9A85YVQL97,"This box does amazing things!  With my Surface Laptop using Windows 10 it converts it into a desktop with 4 monitors all running at fairly high resolutions.  See picture of the finished set up, though the Dell docking station is the little white LED light rather tucked behind the laptop, out of sight and soon out of mind.  Monitor 0 is the one on the laptop, Monitors 1 to 3 are driven by the Dell effortlessly, the mouse moves smoothly from screen to screen.  I've not tried gaming.  It is light and you'll need to clamp the unit down if the wires are not to take over control - see pictures of installed unit.Setup of the Docking station, if you follow the instructions EXACTLY, is a breeze.  It seems that this is in fact mostly due to the excellent hardware and driver software provided by Displaylink but Dell get credit for clear instructions and a neat package.  Maybe it is time to return to Dell after 10 years or more away from them; they used to be the best once.  It could be improved if the USB 3 cable supplied, which is a very strange one that goes to a keyhole shaped port on the back of the unit, has a very stiff cable which is a problem with a light laptop.  A flexible, perhaps flat cable would be much better and, even better, one that has the USB at 90deg to the cable so that it does not need much side room would be good.  That said, the USB plugs in firmly and well and the real miracle is that it works - so much data is transmitted seamlessly.  I have now, within an hour of starting work got 4 monitors each showing different information and gigabit ethernet:0. 2736x18241. 1050x16802. 1920x12003  1080x1920Gigabit ethernet connection.Better still, on one of the monitors I have got a separate 3 way switch (not part of the Dell) so that I can connect a different PC to that monitor.  When I press the button this switch disconnects a monitor from the Dell.  The Dell/Windows 10 detects the change and I have a 3 monitor system.  Click it again and it goes back to being a 4 monitor system.  This is not quite flawless.  Every now and then, one of the monitors will not be correctly synched.  Turning the Dell on and Off once (pull out the power cable so keep it in reach) fixes this, so it is not very bad as it happens infrequently (one to work on though Dell/Displaylink/Microsoft ! ).What's not to like?  Well the Dell User Guide says that the Displaylink software will be loaded with the Drivers and will provide you with some extra functionality that resizes the image on each monitor.  Well it doesn't, at least on my Windows 10 system.  No software is evident anywhere and I really do need to resize one of my displays.  At full monitor resolution all the borders of the display are lost...moving windows then becomes very difficult.I have connected a USB mouse to the unit but it is not recognised.  I've tried various ports to no avail.  No mouse.Not all of the USB ports on the USB hub are powered.  This is strange because the transformer is a 65watt one and the unit runs only a little bit warmer than room temperature so it is not using much power.  So, it is rather annoying that you can't connect and get power on all 5 USB ports if you should need to.  It is also likely to lead to confusion about which one is good for power and some discharged devices from time to time so it is not very user friendly.Given my expectations of what Windows would do for me, this gets a 5.  Someone meaner might have made it a 4 because of the flaws above but, heck, this is an enormous improvement on past Windows kit.",5,29/11/2016,United Kingdom
R20JFN9XMNZR0M,"First off - unfortunately it is poorly advertised (and marketed on the box) as a 'dock', which isn't true. In the traditional sense that you don't 'dock' the laptop into it and it therefore doesn't provide power to your laptop. I knew this from the off so it didn't come as a surprise. It is purely a gadget into which you plug your devices and displays allowing you to connect to everything via a single USB cable into your laptop.That said, it works great. I was apprehensive at some of the reviews but honestly, it's flawless so far. Before I continue, my laptop: It's a Dell Ultrabook with 8GB RAM with a Corei5 CPU. I read somewhere (I'm sure it was on the Dell site) that it recommends a Core i7. That seemed a little odd to me and thankfully that isn't the case.Setup: Download the Windows 10 drivers from the DisplayLink website. The ones Dell provide on their site didn't allow connected monitors to work in Windows 10. If you do install them by mistake however, Windows 10 should show a pop-up that you need to update the drivers. Once I'd run the DisplayLink driver installer and rebooted, everything came to life. I have 2 23"" 1080p monitors connected. You need to go into display settings and use the box that lets you drag the monitor positions around. Once you have that set up, you're away.I also have a stereo amplifier plugged into the device and my audio is now much better as my laptop output jack was playing up previously.People mentioned display lag: For me there is none at all. I'm pleasantly surprised at how flawless it all is. I use a Lenovo X1 Carbon at work (expensive ultrabook) with a Lenovo device which does a similar job to this D3100 and I get lots of display lag on that.Tip: Turn off the Windows 10 screen 'snap' system. It's buried in settings under System > Multi-tasking > Snap (or search snap in the start menu). Otherwise every time you drag a window onto one of your external monitors, the window will try to snap into place at the bottom of the external screen.FY: I haven't tried the displayport connection or 4k and I'm not using the wired ethernet port so I can't comment on the performance of those. I have 2 1080p monitors connected via HDMI, a stereo amp via 3.5mm jack, a mouse and an external hard drive and all work perfectly. No screen lack or dodgy connections.I'm over the moon that I went ahead. I used to have a gaming PC connected up and sadly it's now so old and my laptop is much faster. This device has at least made my laptop a good device to use at my desk.",5,27/01/2016,United Kingdom
R3FNZE6CSW1B0Y,"I used this on a Windows 10 pro Dell M3800 laptop and wanted to use it with two 4K Samsung U28E590 monitors instead of the laptop display and 1 monitor. It feels like a quality product and is easy to set up (just go to Dell website and download driver before connecting).My only disappointment was that I missed the fact that it can't support two 4K monitors at the same time, only a 4K on one port and lower resolutions on the others. I had looked at several and by the time I found ""Ultra HD Triple Video"" thought it supported up to three 4K monitors. Well, it does, but not with them actually at 4K.It's true that had I downloaded the spec first or read all the questions the information was there but I think the description is misleading.As far as its specification goes, it works well, I use the USB 2 and 3 ports and the Displayport to a 4K monitor running at 3480x2161 plus an HDMI port to another 4K monitor running at 2560x1440.I gave 4 stars based on the 5 for quality and working smoothly but 3 for description.",4,29/01/2019,United Kingdom

It looks really nice as well, and not just a dull grey box. Pretty straight forward installation. The only thing to be aware of (and I had over looked this) is you'll need a DisplayPort to HDMI cable as well as a HDMI to HDMI cable if you want to run two monitors.

R2OYRORU9KQBZB,"The Dell Dock is a great product from Dell, but buy it only from the actual Dell UK website. I have been having an issue, which is inherit to such devices sometimes and something that warranty easily covers. However, as the seller buys the Dock from Singapore with a basic warranty, which means that according to Dell for them to cover you the system must be in the purchase location. Now my Dell Dock does not work and it cannot be replaced from warranty although such replacement was granted if I was in Singapore.  I cannot contact the seller as the time allowed since I have bought it has passed.TO THE SELLER:  Knowingly and dishonestly withholding information amounts to misrepresentation under the Misrepresentation Act 1967 in the UK. In this case, as warranty is clearly a big factor on such product and the fact that warranty cannot work in the UK as you purchased from Dell in Singapore should be disclosed along with the warranty limitations. This would have been key information I ought to know at the time of purchase.If you are able to assist me with obtaining the warranty and have a warehouse in Singapore, where a technician can come out review my dock and replace it, do let me know. Alternatively, if you have any other solutions, please do let me know.",1,16/07/2024,United Kingdom

R37T0LI8N3IKC2,"First, some background..I have a high performance Dell 7510, Xeon processor, 64GB ram, 4k screen with M.2 SSD's it is the bomb..It also has 1x HDMI and 1x mini Display port.Despite all this, when connecting my 2 x 4k wide screen monitors directly from the laptops HDMI and Display Port I can never ever get the colours on both looking right. HDM and Display Port will give different colours and contrast, you need to have both HDMI or display port. I even got an adapter to go Display port to HDMI so they was both connected via HDMI. But this was also no good.I spent months frustrated with poor image quality, colours and ghosting on the text. (yes all my drivers was up to date)I plunged for the USB 3.0 HD Triple Video adapter. (I refuse to call it a docking station as you do not dock the laptop on it)This small piece of kit is simply amazing,Before plugging in the adapter via USB, first visit displaylink.com and download the latest driver for your OS.I then plugged in the the adapter and plugged both my monitors, 1 with HDM and one with Display Port.Oh know!... I still have crap looking screens...But Wait.. this adapter has 2 HDMI ports so why not try going directly from HDMI to HDMI..I connected both monitors via HDMI, the max output gave me 1920x1080 on one monitor and a max of 2560×1440 on another. You can only output 2560 on one monitor.This was fine for my needs, I use the higher resolution for photo editing and the other screen for emails and docs etc..What was so perfect was the fact (despite different screen resolutions) I finally had 2 perfect matching screens both showing the same colour and contrast / brightness with no ghosting what so ever!If my laptop had 2 HDMI ports then I would not have needed this so if you are in the same position or similar then do not hesitate to try this.To sum up, The HDMI ports are full HDMI, there is no midi HDMI. The Display port is also a full display port not a mini display port.The extra USB 3 ports come in hand as does the network port.Get it.. It just works..",5,05/12/2016,United Kingdom

R1G3P2B3HKK3YP,"The Dell Dock certainly over promises and under delivers.It is a Macbook pro issue for sure, however this should be stated before purchasing or in the description.Macbook pro users (with the silicone chips such as M1's) won't be able to duplicate their monitors if they have 2 screens. If you are using this for 1 external monitor, then don't hesitate to get it and go for it. 2 monitors however, then please keep clear.Using it with a work laptop which probably won't have a dedicated graphics card and if you have 2 decent (i.e 4K monitors) then it will struggle with the frame rate and your laptop will be forced to either compromise on the pixel resolution or the frame rate. Which then renders your nice monitor a little useless and you could have got more basic monitors.The good things about the Dell Dock is that it is well built, it feels solid.It has plenty of USB ports and the LAN attachment is great. The USB wire coming out also feels premium.I had to return it as it was giving too many issues for connecting multiple displays.

RZME05KNN6LE5,"Much more useful than first thought. I use my laptop mainly as a desktop for college work, and the ability to detach from keyboard, mouse, and screen by one cable is very handy, I have routed the cables much more nicely than having them trail all over the laptop and desk. I have also had to work from home at times and attaching the docking station to my works laptop (also Dell) saves a lot of time and rerouting of all peripheral cables. I did as the instructions said (and on the advice of other reviewers) and made sure the drivers were updated before installing, and have had no issues with the docking station. It would be nice to switch the laptop on without opening the lid, and it is a little pricey, but other than that I think it is worth the time saved on taking out multiple cables constantly.EDIT 02/06/2020 - I wrote the above review back on Nov 2017. The docking station is still going strong, and has proven invaluable now I work and study at home constantly during the COVD-19 pandemic.

It was getting rather frustrating! Finally decided to invest a bit of money. The item I wanted was a little out of my price range, so I thought I would give this one a go and I’m very pleased with it. It was so easy to set up, straight out of the box. I was worried that I’d have to fiddle around with installing a driver or something and I’m really not tech minded, however, it was really as simple as plugging in (to the mains and laptop) and attaching the screens, mouse and keyboard and away I went. Couldn’t be more pleased. It sits nicely at the side of my desk and doesn’t take up too much room. I might have liked it to have the option to stand up, so the space used was even less, but I can live with that. When it’s been on all day it does feel a little warm to the touch, but so far that doesn’t seem to be an issue. One thing to note is that the speakers now go through the docking station - took me a while to work out why I couldn’t hear when in my zoom meeting, until I thought to plug some headphones into the dock and hey presto, back in the game!",5,01/08/2020,United Kingdom

I wanted a docking station which would include USB ports, audio and screen extending onto 3 external screens.  This product uses DisplayLink which worked out of the box on Win10, but required a driver install (available from Dell's website) for Windows 7.  The front 3 ports are USB 3, with 2 rear USB 2 (e.g. for Keyboard / Webcam).  There is a front headphone socket and rear headphone/mic socket.  I don't have any need for the ethernet connection in this instance.  The device is great, and allows my to use my desk setup of monitors, keyboard, mouse, webcam with any computer I attach (e.g. laptop / desktop etc).  Because it doesn't require DP Alt Mode, it works on older USB machines.  Highly recommended.

R1X1V57RI23MJ,"I purchased this so I could quickly hook up my Dell XPS 15 to my monitors and peripherals without having to plug in a ton of usb cables into the laptop itself.I am powering two 25"" Dell monitors through this, and the first thing I noticed was that there is a fair bit of screen tearing going on. The response is definitely not as smooth and seamless as with native HDMI coming from the laptop, which was disappointing. Although not as frequent as the screen tearing, there is also some artifacting going on in certain applications. It gives the feel that the visual presentation is being ""emulated"" rather than a true, native output.Another gripe is that my monitors (running at 2560 x 1440) can only run at a maximum of 50hz using the dock. For me, this is not hugely important but I can still notice the difference and it is somewhat annoying, particularly when watching 60hz content, as this can judder unnaturally.Apart from this, it does a decent job at handling all the USB peripherals I plug into it, as well as audio and network, none of which I've had any problems with.

From what I understand on Linux the DisplayLink drivers recruit the CPU to aid in graphical operations which leads to MONSTROUS CPU usage from DisplayLink. On my laptop (Dell XPS13 2015) I see CPU usage regularly sitting at 70-90%. This drops to 10% if there's no action on the screen but even the movement of a cursor causes it to jump to those high ranges.This bit of kit works great and does its job well when supported by the correct software - but buyer beware if you try getting this working with Linux.

The Dell technician did not even mention this possibility in my pre sales request for help.I found that ""DisplayLink"" produce the graphics drivers and they were excellent and responded very promptly to help resolve the problem. Dell tech support responded 2 days after DisplayLink to tell me to try another department as my contracted support were not able to support peripherals! (Even though branded ""Dell""?)I still have a German plug and no manual etc as these are on the CD which wont run.Of course I could have sent it back to Amazon and they would have replaced it - presumeably with the same problems.Suggest you do look for an alternative and do check that Amazon realise you live in the UK and want a UK plug if you have it shipped to you in the UK and, of course, do check that it is compatible with your software!",1,10/11/2015,United Kingdom
R2X8MV3361QHXZ,"Like a lot of people, I imagine, I got my Dell D3100 docking station when I started working from home at the outbreak of Covid19. Suddenly the room I’d always earmarked as an office needed to actually become an office!From the start, it’s worked great, and is a nicely compact bit of kit that isn’t taking up desk space. Just needed one AI ole driver download at the beginning which was no issue.Personally, I’m running 2 HDMI monitors out the back which have both worked perfectly from the word go, whilst in the front 3 USB ports  I’ve got plugged in a mouse, keyboard and headset. Everything plug & played without issue. And with this setup all running off the Dell D3100 I’ve got everything I need to run my home office. No complaints.Here’s to lots more working from home when the lockdown is over 👍🏻",5,21/04/2020,United Kingdom
RL6ME3I7Q4GXQ,"I wanted to expanded my monitor real estate for a while and kept putting it off as there are so many docks at various price points. I finally bit the bullet and purchased one of the cheapest ones I could find from a brand I trust. The dock was super easy to install and before I knew it I was running an additional two monitors from my laptop (so I had three monitors going in total) and all the wires I usually had running from my laptops USB ports were now hidden away connected to the dock. Not only that, the way I set up the dock on my desk means I have three more USB ports (on the front of the dock) to charge devices and connect externalHD's to as and when required. I should have done this sooner! A great dock for anyone starting out down the expansion route.",5,01/11/2019,United Kingdom

It swaps between my personal MacBook and my work Surface Pro. So i don't have to have one specific piece of kit for either setup its just power for the device and a USB cable. What more could you want in a dock!!! Also has the added extra of me being able to add another monitor should i want to appear more NASA like lolThis dock is multi-platform and works with Mac, Linux and PC and for £130 quid its a bargain.",5,31/12/2018,United Kingdom
R9RPEDGJD441B,"In other words, don't expect this to charge your laptop via USB-C, as other real Dell docking stations will do.The USB 3.0 ports on this port replicator have too low a voltage to charge, for example, a Dell Lattitude 5400.My dock at work (a DWxx series) with a hard strapped USB-C charges the laptop just fine.  So does the D6000 series.  But not this.As a port replicator this is great - I love the 2xHDMI + 1xDP and all the USB ports...

R2M5QFK1Y3GPQL,"I bought this to go with a new Dell XPS13. There are several docks for the XPS13, with varying prices and varying reviews. They all have some very bad reviews, including this one. I found that it works fine. I wanted to run 2 separate FHD monitors in extended desktop mode and have wired Ethernet. It took a few minutes updating its drivers or whatever in Win 10, but that all happened automatically and after that it just works. The extra USB ports for mouse, printer etc. are also very welcome.I'm not a big fan of video compression on principle, but display link (built in) seems to be OK. The ideal dock would be one just like this but using the USB (c) thunderbolt port with no compression, but until that comes along this one is brilliant",5,05/12/2016,United Kingdom

No extra drivers needed on chromebook , all setup straight away - amazing!I Can't really say the same about windows/Dell drivers - , big drivers download needed - sometimes forgets the dock drivers exist, when hotpluging after meetings - but quite stable in normal use.But at the end of the day, its a smart little box if you want a usb3 multi monitor setup, and at decent price from the seller.",5,15/11/2018,United Kingdom

It was placed just below the monitor and never moved it again.After a year or so I had to move the docking station aside. I unplugged the HDMI cables and the case connectors literally crumbled under my grip to bits and the entire thing came apart !I was shocked and had to put it back together with a bandage (literally as the case connectors broke off) that wrapped around the entire case to keep the ""station"" in one piece.It still works as the inside chips were not damaged.Am I a joke to you Dell?

R3J6K93CLHLWGJ,"I struggled in deciding how many stars to give.  I really didn't get on with this headset and ultimately returned it so 1 star, right?  No, not at all.In my view these are are well built, look good, Jabra software works nicely (Windows in my case), the red light when in use is surprisingly useful (mainly to others so they can see you're on a call), the sound quality isn't bad, and they are relatively comfortable.  So at least 4 stars then? Not quite ...Sound isolation/noise cancelling is where it all went a bit wrong for me.  It works - very well in fact.  Popping this headset on meant that the outside world largely disappeared but sadly this includes your own voice and this is just weird.  Jabra are obviously aware of this and have included a feature called ""Sidetone"".  With this feature enabled, your own voice is played into your headset as you speak.  You can control the volume of this Sidetone but no matter what volume I used, it just sounded really freaky to me.  There is a *very* slight delay (milliseconds) on the Sidetone sound but it's enough for me to truly hate this feature and ultimately return the item.So, if your use case is in a particularly noisy environment (call centre perhaps?), and if you are not particularly sensitive to hearing your own voice through the headset, I imagine that this model would be near perfect.If, like me, you are simply after a high quality headset for use in a quieter home environment then I'd recommend looking elsewhere.  For me, I have settled on the much cheaper Jabra Evolve 20 that I found lying around in a cupboard.  The sound isolation is much weaker meaning I can hear my own voice without Sidetone (which isn't offered on this cheaper model anyway), and the voice sound quality is adequate.3 stars it is then ! :-)",3,19/08/2021,United Kingdom
R1YP896ZAXA2N,"Materially this feels pretty nice. The cable is shortish, so you can't go wandering around your office with these on - but on the other hand you don't get tangled up in masses of cable. I may have a fat head, because on maximum extension these only just fit me. It comes with a little thin soft foam bag, which keeps it from getting knocked around in your laptop bag.The fancy features like lifting/lowering the mic to mute/unmute, and all the LEDs, only work in very specific apps even if you install the Jabra Direct software. In Google Meets those features definitely don't work (Jabra support say that Google needs to support ""RCC"") and instead it acts like a dumb headset and you have to click the on-screen mute button like an animal. In Zoom the fancy features work.It also works fine for playing music.",4,20/06/2021,United Kingdom
R2E0811D50CRGW,"This headset is built great (as you’d expect for the price) and delivers good quality audio. However the mic sits way to close to my face, pretty much rubbing against my cheek, unless I adjust it to sit further forward on my ear. Also, it’s very easy for these to slip of ur head if you are tilting your head downward. Oh and the cable gets twisted really easily.The noise cancellation for the call receiver seems pretty decent but I can hear the outside world still when on calls.Overall I’d probably say it’s a 7/10 simply due to the fact it could be a lot better in above departments for its price.",3,23/06/2022,United Kingdom
R1QEC9I1TR8G2J,Overall I am pleased with the Jabra Evolve 2 - USB C version. I had been using the original Jabra Evolve headset in my previous job and bought this for my new role. Sound quality and overall build seems good. However the cable is very stiff and conducts sound to the headset when knocked against something such as my desk. The older model had a much more flexible cable. Its probably better to buy the wireless version. It looses a star because of the cable.,4,12/01/2021,United Kingdom
RFL3JQ0EQD7WJ,"Had high hopes for these, but it was a waste of money in the end. I changed to Anker Q20 for half the cost and they are a lot more comfortable.If you wear glasses the pressure of the ear cups against your ears squashes against the arms of your glasses quite a lot, so after an hour you need to take them off as it's quite painful.Also, the headphones don't stay on your head very well, if you have to keep looking down to read stuff on your desktop and then back up to your screen the headband slides forward or back off your head.",2,09/11/2023,United Kingdom

No joke.Speaking louder seemed to help, but if I wanted my neighbours to hear I'd use the mic from my computer.Tbh I'd send them back if I didn't need them for next couple of weeks. And don't think anything else will perform much better.  So keeping them.I got the Teams USB C version with a mac if that matters.",3,02/07/2021,United Kingdom
R26IK5NK1VRD3U,Good quality product that works well on Windows 10. Sound quality is very good. Integration with MS Teams is good and useful.Some negatives that prevent 5 stars:1) the mic is a bit flimsy and perhaps a bit closer to my face than I'd like.2) Cable is too short really.3) personally I'd prefer a mute button on the cable rather than on the headset.,4,21/02/2021,United Kingdom
R342LEJWIQ4WP9,"I bought these headphones.  They arrived in time, no damage or anything.  Good comms from the seller, except that I queried the connector with the seller (USB A or C and I had bought the wrong one, so my fault there). So  I bought an adaptor for £6.  Imagine my surprise then, having queried it with the seller, when I was putting my headphones in their bag today and out fell an A to C adaptor, which comes with the headphones.  So I wasted £6.  Seller doesn't know their own product.  The ear pads are not comfortable for me.  They might be for anybody else. But I can definitely hear outside sounds while they are on so I would define these as noise lessening not noise isolating.",3,08/06/2020,United Kingdom
R2OU6ZZBNXTH0C,"They’re not too bad of a headset overall.There is a connection problem on the type-c to my laptop.This was never mentioned upon purchasing this product. Any slight movement in the cable, it disconnects and reconnects the headset.Noise cancellation is really good but the sound is not, you have to turn the volume up really loud to get a decent sound output.The original retail price I would certainly not pay for it with such flaws.",3,18/08/2021,United Kingdom
RK0GW314ZL2UT,"The comfort, sound quality and microphone are all very good, very happy with these aspects of the headset.The USB C cable is short and kinks a lot. I had the Jabra Evolve 40 previously, it's cable never kinked. This is a big disappointment as it's very frustrating when using this for hours a day at work as it kinks so much there's no slack, constantly have to straighten out the kinks which will likely shorten the lifespan of the headset.When the headset eventually fails I won't be replacing it with the same one.",2,06/02/2023,United Kingdom

R1BNX1JZF2279N,"I used the headset to write this review using the built in Microsoft dictation software so apologies if there are any spelling mistakes.The Jambra headset comes in a nice felt pouch this is very useful if you intend to take it out travelling although it is quite bulky. The headset itself has left and right punched into the ear pieces which are slightly padded.I'm finding the headset very slightly slippery on my head the bar at the top is thinner than most headphones so there's not a lot of grip. There doesn't appear to be a significant ability to adjust the size of the headband up top. The usb cable has an led which is red on both sides of it as it attaches to the computer.This is usable if you have a laptop but might not be so if you have this plugged in to a desktop machine. The led shows whether the system is muted or not.There are two methods available to mute or unmute the headset. The 1st is via a button on the front of the right hand speaker. The second method is by lifting the microphone boom upwards. At the moment the system is reporting to me a muted or unmuted status in the headphones as I lift or drop the microphone boom. This may appear useful but I'm sure it won't stop people being double muted in meetings.Using the headphones to listen to music or some videos the quality appears to be reasonable, so I don't expect there to be any issues using these for online meetings.There are four other buttons available on the headset on the side with the right hand speaker there is an aunt or end call button which I suspect is useful mainly for people in call centres. On the back right of the headset there is a volume down pause and volume up button.Overall the headset seems good quality and should last several years if one needs it for regularly attending online meetings.",4,12/03/2024,United Kingdom
R1J1N3CCQR0ED6,"A well-known company makes this headset, hence the high price as the headset is very well made and has a definite feel of quality on all the parts, when you hold it you will be able to tell that this is an excellent headset and will work exceptionally well.Having said this there are other headsets which are just as well made and of excellent quality but are far cheaper than these ones. So do shop around especially, as this set is corded, there is no Bluetooth so it has lots of limitations in that respect, in fact, this set is meant for Microsoft Teams or for a call centre, as you have a microphone which you pull down.I'm not a music geek so all I want is a good headset which has good voice quality and is easy to use without any difficult features, this headset does tick all of those boxes, I very much appreciate the noise cancelling feature, it works well. I am not sure if you can upload any updates for this headset, as it has no Bluetooth, but if I am wrong in this respect then no doubt someone will correct me, but in my view I cannot see how you can download any updates.When I used this set I can honestly say it was very comfortable and did not hurt my ears as the cushioned earpieces are very soft, but you can feel them though they don't hurt in any way, adjustment is simple as well and they stay over the ears really well, so top marks for this part, however, my only issue is the price, I think they are a bit too expensive if they were Bluetooth I would understand the price, but for corded headsets this is not cheap, having said that the blue tooth ones are even more expensive.As they are made a known company there tends to be a bit of a premium to pay, so if you want a good quality set and can afford the price then these are excellent, I am giving this headset four stars, also, if you want them for gaming the cord is too short, you need wireless ones, these are not good for that purpose.",4,02/03/2024,United Kingdom
R1YZ8CNBPPAFSY,"The Jabra Evolve2 40 SE Wired Headset is a premium choice for professionals seeking superior sound quality and effective noise cancellation in their communications. Featuring advanced 3-mic call technology, this headset ensures that your voice is crystal clear on calls, reducing background noise significantly and enhancing the overall call experience. It's particularly useful for remote workers or anyone who spends a significant amount of time on conference calls via platforms like Zoom and Google Meet.The noise-cancelling feature of the Evolve2 40 SE is noteworthy, providing a focused listening environment by effectively blocking out background noise. This makes it ideal for use in busy office environments or home offices where controlling ambient noise is not always possible. The stereo sound quality is exceptional, offering rich audio that is perfect not only for calls but also for music and multimedia.Comfort is another area where this headset excels. Designed for prolonged use, the Evolve2 40 SE comes with cushioned ear cups and an adjustable headband that ensure a comfortable fit, even during long work sessions. The USB-C cable provides a reliable and fast connection to your computer or other devices, ensuring high-quality sound transmission without latency issues.However, as a wired headset, it does lack the flexibility of wireless models, which might be a drawback for users who prefer the freedom to move around while on calls. Additionally, the premium features and quality of the Jabra Evolve2 40 SE come with a higher price tag, which is worth considering based on your specific needs and budget.The Jabra Evolve2 40 SE Wired Noise-Cancelling Headset is a top-tier option for professionals who prioritize sound quality, call clarity, and comfort in their daily communications. Its compatibility with leading unified communications platforms makes it a versatile tool in any professional toolkit. While the absence of wireless connectivity and the premium price might be considerations for some, the performance and quality it offers are undeniably impressive, making it a worthwhile investment for serious users.",5,05/02/2024,United Kingdom

R1AL6CGNR5UYGK,"I have been using this for MS Teams and like it. I’ll address some negative aspects that I’ve read in another review first:* “Clamping force makes wearing for long periods uncomfortable and no way to adjust” – this headset is more closed C shaped than an open U shape so does push in slightly at the sides of the head which can’t be rectified although there is some limited headband/bar flex. It does feel comfortable between calls though when rested around the neck. The head bar length can be adjusted in size by sliding out the earphone pieces from the headband and this makes the size larger and it is padded but there is still the pushing in at the sides of the head that can be felt, although this is mild so bearable although I haven’t tested using this for many hours on end.* “Difficult to hear own voice (muffled), results in your having to talk louder” – this is the noise-cancelling earphones doing their job. The mono headset option might be better if you want to hear your own voice crisply rather than the stereo version which covers both ears. This is not an issue for me.* “Because the microphone only works on right side, then cable only sits on right side, which if you're right-handed interferes with using a mouse” – this is easy to fix with cable management but I get the point. It would have been easier to fix if the microphone was usable on both the right and the left side of the face but it isn’t, or if the headset was wireless.My own negative that I had is that when you mute/unmute this it says in your ear “muted”/”unmuted” which drowns out the Teams conversation so you might miss something during that second.There are plenty of positives of course with this though:* The sound and mic are quality as you’d expect from Jabra.* It’s noise-cancelling without cupping your ears, so your ears don’t get as hot when using for a long time like they would with other headsets with ear cushions that surround your ears (on-ear as opposed to over-ear).* The features work well. The mute/unmute can be done with moving the mic arm up or down, or with a button on the right earcup. The other buttons for volume or playing music are on the earcup too and are not overly complicated.* I can end the call easily by pressing the button on the outside of the right earcup whereas before I had to manoeuvre my mouse to click the leave button first, which can lead to those awkward few moments at the end of the call when you’ve said bye but not left yet.* It comes in a protective cloth pouch that protects the headset when not in use.All-in-all then 4-stars with a star knocked off for the “clamping”.⭐⭐⭐⭐🎧",4,12/02/2024,United Kingdom

R2FFNZ9UXNK62G,"Due to the ongoing train strikes, my partner often has to work from home and this often means having video meetings with other nurses and doctors, so i thought i would pick up this headset for her as it could be useful, especially during the school holidays when we have an 8 year old boy running around and jabbering away in the background.Being an on-ear design, the headset itself is actually quite compact and a lot slimmer than the over-ear style that require deep ear cups.The whole thing is made from very sturdy and high quality feeling plastics, with the exception of the sliding arms being made from Aluminium. The underside of the headband is extremely soft and comfortable on the head.Both the left and right ear pads are made from soft memory foam and are mounted to self-adjusting ear cup swivels, whilst hidden away inside are 40mm speakers.The right cup is also home to the microphone boom, which is fitted with 3 x MEMs microphone chips to ensure clear communication, even in noisier environments. When the boom is in the raised position, the mic will be automatically muted and will unmute when pulled down towards the mouth.The buttons are also located on this side, with a single button on the front towards the top that will also mute/unmute the mic. There are 3 buttons to the rear that are used to increase or decrease the volume, as well as forward and skip tracks forwards or backwards and to play and pause. Finally, you have a circular button in the centre of the right cup that can be used to answer or end calls.The headset connects to your computer, smartphone or tablet via a 145cm long cable fitted with a USB-C plug.You also have the option of downloading the Jabra Direct app to your computer, which will let you update any firmware on the set, as well as customise various settings.***** In The Box *****1 x Evolve2 40SE Headset1 x Felt Storage Pouch***** Conclusion *****This is my first experience of the Jabra brand and i have to say that overall i’m pretty impressed.The headset itself looks and feels quite premium, the speakers sound very good when listening to music and the microphone is nice and clear when video calling.My favourite feature has to be being able to mute the mic by simply raising the arm out of the way – this saves having to mess around trying to find a button, making it much more convenient.My only slight disappointment is the very basic felt/carpet style pouch, which doesn’t match the look of quality feel of the product. I would have much preferred some kind of hard shell type case for added protection – especially given that the headset isn’t particularly cheap, with the current asking price being £107.Other than that, i think the product itself is very good and definitely worth considering if you need a decent sounding headset for video and phone calls.",4,07/02/2024,United Kingdom

R2NQYP7JHXQVWA,"My partner was provided with the Jabra Evolve2 40 (USB A) headset by her work for video/audio conferences. I already own an older Jabra Evolve headset and some mpow headsets as they are cheap and work fine.I thought people should be aware of the shortcomings of the Evolve2 40 before bothering to buy them, which I wouldn't recommend. There are cheaper alternatives that are way better.They are heavy and uncomfortable. The earpads look thick but they aren't, they're thin and you can easily feel the plastic earpiece through them.The cable is way too short. It would be difficult to use these with anything but a laptop sitting on the desk directly in front of you and even then the cable feels short.  Also it's a hard wired USB cable so you can't use the headset on a mobile phone and PC. Therefore restricting their practicality. For the price they should have a USB puck and the headset have a standard 3.5mm jack that plugs into the puck.Changing volume and muting from the headset is very awkward with the buttons on the right hand earpiece. You inevitably press the wrong button and turn the volume up or down instead of muting.There's no manual in the box!The LEDs showing you're on an call are annoying and as others have said they make you look odd while on video calls.They aren't noise cancelling in any way I could tell. The earpads don't sit well anyway so you can easily hear surrounding noise regardless of any cancelling these may provide.They are a mic on the right hand side use only! Can't believe this. You cannot use these with the mic on the left hand side as it doesn't rotate sufficiently to allow it. So if you think you'll be able to get more cable if they plug into the left of your laptop, by having it come out of the left earpiece, you can't. This, for me, is astounding for a headset. Never seen a decent headset that can't have the mic on both sides. I've bought headsets for under twenty pounds that allow this.So I'm shocked that this is really a Jabra headset as usually they are so good. Not this one though, especially for the price. Save some money and get an older Jabra model.",1,11/10/2020,United Kingdom

R1W5XJ9VJN99EX,"This compact tool makes personal hygiene cleaning away from home quick and easy. Its lightweight design fits neatly into a rucksack for camping trips or bagging Munro's. The two pressure settings provide flexibility: the gentler mode works well for use on the skin, while the stronger one delivers notable power for such a small unit – ideal for rinsing muddy dog paws too, especially at this time of the year. The inclusion of USB-C charging is always a big plus, and the battery lasts through multiple uses before needing a recharge. If I was being picky, I'd like the water bottle's capacity to be a little larger, as it requires fairly frequent refills but it's a very minor gripe as it's hardly an inconvenience for me. On the whole, it’s robust, easy to use, and a more practical option than relying on wet wipes or unpredictable public facilities. I always make sure this is packed in my rucksack before exploring the great outdoors.",5,13/12/2024,United Kingdom
R38ZRNMB5R9C34,"Let's not beat about the bush. This is for cleaning your bum after a bowel movement. Some important background information: I'm a man and I've previously been using wet wipes for this purpose. I've used Japanese toilets before and have marvelled at how well they clean but it never occurred to me that I could reproduce that easily, inexpensively and without replacing my toilet. This product achieves all of that. It's simple to use and incredibly effective, I'm absolutely delighted with the results. It will no doubt pay for itself in short order with the money I'm saving on wipes and it's much better for my drainsThere are some very minor issues. The bottle is of limited capacity and I find I have to fill it twice per cleaning. That's no problem at all at home but may not be possible in a more public setting. On the other hand, the device is compatible with other bottles that match the threading so you could combine it with a larger water bottle you carry around for drinking. I find I end up with a fair amount of water on the toilet seat after using which, again, is hardly a deal breaker and easily wiped up but just making sure you are armed with all of the facts. There's no indicator on the device as to how much charge is remaining and I'd be devastated to run out mid-cleaning so I've been very cautious about charging it frequently. The manual does state you get 30 minutes out of a single charge which I imagine should keep you covered for weeks at a time",5,16/02/2025,United Kingdom

It lasted me a solo weekend just fine out in the woods.The pressure is quite decent and cleans quite well. The only thing I would note is that it tends to wizz through it's water tank so you may need to have a refill nearby otherwise it can get awkward.There's no setup and it's one button to operate.

RIVP89YXHOCZ4,"Having bidets in all my bathrooms means I really need a portable option when I travel. This little gadget is super handy, compact, and a breeze to use. It delivers a surprisingly powerful water stream, making sure you get a thorough clean.Charging it is as easy as can be, just 15 minutes and you’re good for about 20 uses before it needs another charge. Its size is perfect for travel; it fits right into my toiletries bag without taking up too much room. It’s great for everything from hotel stays to camping trips and even airports.The water storage could be a bit bigger, but then it might lose its portability, so I think it’s a fair trade-off. All in all, it’s a fantastic little device that has made traveling way more comfortable. If you’re thinking about it, just go for it—you won’t be disappointed!",5,03/12/2024,United Kingdom

RMZVDX3X72KFH,I'm a domestic electrician and whilst working in peoples' houses I often need to turn the power off for extended periods during the day. With people working from home a lot of the time this can be slightly inconvenient - I want to crack on with my job but then the customer has a video-conference call they need to attend and it's always when I need the power off!Having seen a great review of the Jackery 240 by another electrician I follow on Instagram I made the plunge and bought one. It is insanely useful for keeping my customers happy. I turn up and plug their internet router into this thing and they run all day with no interruptions to internet access.Goes easily into the van as it is small and lightweight and charges up when I get home ready to go again the next day. Build quality seems excellent and the cables that come with it are sturdy too.Information shown on the screen tells me how much power is being used and how much charge is left in the batteries. A great addition to the tools in the van and has probably saved me so much time waiting for customers to get off conference calls that it has paid for itself inside a month or two.,5,19/05/2021,United Kingdom

R1K7T2Q94TZ2HF,"I now use two of these units to power my astrophotography gear one for the mount / cameras, the other to keep the laptop going, based on another unit I really didn't think the unit will sustain a good 12v supply and a 220v charge. They are well up to a mount powered for 4 - 5 hours and still have plenty of power left I'm usually down to around 60% at the end of a session, depending how charged the laptop was to begin with. Supply is both stable and steady which is essential for astro gear, no gradual creeping down to 11v that I used to see with an SLA battery, they also seem less prone to low temperatures.Update July 2023 - For astrophotography I am now running mount, cooled CMOS camera, focuser and automated dew control via a Pegasus powerbox. I ran for about 6 hours this week starting around 85% charge. By the end of the session the charge was down to 13% and voltage was down to round 11.7v (measured by the powerbox - not the Jackery). Bearing in mind that in July dew point does not get low enough to kick in the dew bands it seems clear that a long session mid winter will need a bigger battery box or supplementary charging.",5,02/07/2023,United Kingdom

It runs a laptop and my phones with ease. I use it in the garden to run a projector to watch films against my garage wall.

R2648GNQTJBGS4,"Finally an easy backup power solution for household appliances that is both user friendly and so simple even a child can use.We live in the UK Peak District and usually get 2-3 blackouts per year anyway, that was before taking into account the current energy crisis as a result of the 2022 geopolitical situation. So this was something of a considered gamble, having grown weary of how messy, fussy and user unfriendly fuel generators still insist on being in order to operate safely.Tested this to run our wifi router for an entire afternoon, and later as a stress test to run my home office, consisting of 3x3w bulb standing lamp, DAB radio, iPhone w/ hotspot on USB charge, 15” laptop for email and word processing in dock, printer (mostly on standby) & 32” LED PC monitor. This ran the entire setup for 3 hours.Very versatile and doesn’t require any messy maintenance or extra converters/parts etc to use safely. Just literally unplug whatever you want to run from the mains and plug it back in to the standard UK plug socket on the front of the unit, press the little button by the display and then just carry on as normal, multi-plugs are fine too, so long as the load of connected electricals does not exceed 200w total.At £259 this 200w model isn’t cheap, but there are few things in the western world that are worse than a power cut, and this keeps those little conveniences running regardless. Once depleted, plug it in to the mains overnight with the charger provided and it’s ready to go again. As other reviewers have said, this does make a bit of a noise and emit a vague synthetic chemical smell when in use, as a fan will intermittently start up, akin to a high-end desktop PC, but this is probably unavoidable given the thermodynamics involved. At least this can be safely used indoors right next to whatever you need to power.Larger models are available (500 & 1000 watt) and I can now see the appeal of these, but will wait to see how this performs long term before purchasing another.",5,01/11/2022,United Kingdom
R1RSA7AQ2LNIGX,"I am not a"" Tecno"" so i can not give you technical figures on performance. The Jackery 240 V2 came well before scheduled delivery time. The unit came well packed. First impression the exterior looked solid and well built, the LCD screen was simple and clear. The station came 30% charged  it took about 4hrs using the A/C lead to charge up 100%. The Jackery 240 i consider a basic entry level ,ideal for LED lighting charging small tools and emergency power. Ideal forfor caravaners and outside pursuits. I not sure of the longevity of the Jackery i have only had the power station for two weeks. But all is working at the moment. I have a few minor issues/suggestions that Jackery could take up. First there is no dust cap on the DC output port. Second the A/C socket should be higher up where the light (swopped with the light)  to cater for larger plugs). Lastly a safety concern the A/C outlet should have a RCD socket especially as a lot of customers  will be using the station outside. That said a good entry level power station.",4,05/03/2025,United Kingdom

I'm more impressed with the solar panels as they worked great even in gloomy weather.I've marked the rating down one star for sheer inconvenience, since the delivery courier decided to try to deliver a day early (when I wasn't going to be in) and then gave my parcels to the Post Office without letting me know where they were.  I ended up having to chase it to try and find out where they'd left it.  When I contacted the seller, I was advised ""you will need to collect it yourself"" which wasn't the most helpful suggestion.  Next time, might be a good idea to stick to the actual delivery dates chosen by the customer and (if it can't be delivered for some reason and is going to be left somewhere else) let them know where it actually is instead of it just showing as ""delivered"".

R2CXEKDMWYT6MX,"The Jackery 240 is a decent piece of kit and it outputs 230v reliably.  There are lots of glowing reports on here, most of which are pretty spot on, but there are a few  niggly things that are worth mentioning from my experience of it.1: You manually turn on each power source,  12v, USB or 230v with a little button next to each socket.  Each source consumes power to do its own inversion. For example the 230v inverter draws 10w even before you plug anything in.  If you forget to turn it off when you've done it sits there drawing 10w until the battery is flat.  It should really have an auto off function. I can imagine many unhappy campers waking up to a flat battery because they forgot to turn it off.2: The fan is quite noisy, and kicks in once you start to draw around 70w+3: The supplied charger is quite slow, max 60W so takes a good 4-5 hours to charge up from flat.  I have seen videos online showing it charging at 100W with other PSU's so it's a bit tight of the manufacturer to only include a 60W PSU at this price.4: the 230v socket (on the UK model) is situated right at the bottom of the unit. Because most UK plugs have cable strain relievers on, when you plug in, the plug strain reliever protrudes beyond the bottom of the Jackery, so you cant have the Jackery stood on its 4 feet and have to tilt it back, making it unsteady, not ideal.I am not disappointed with this purchase, as it does everything I needed it to do, but just wanted to give other potential buyers some considerations that I didn't have before I hit the buy it now button.",4,29/03/2022,United Kingdom

R2TG8W5L52W94Z,"Advertised as charging off of USB-C, but appears to need a voltage higher than 5v to charge (e.g. 9v, 12v etc). This means that one of your solar chargers you probably already have wont work to charge this up since they output at 5v.  Very annoying.When you do connect a larger panel, the unit appears to turn on and connect to the internet etc at even the very smallest amount of light hitting the panel, so it seems to use more power than it gains on cloudy/winter days, so it will discharge by 2 to 3% per day for me when the app says it is only getting 3 or 4 watts from the solar panel.  It would be nice if it could be in a deeper state of hibernation or something when the solar input is low so this does not occur.Otherwise app connection seems decent enough and appears to use Google Firebase (I expected Tuya or something) so is reliable and responsive and you can connect to it from your phone when you are not at home - I have mine connected to my house's wifi from the bottom end of the garden in the shed, so I can keep an eye on it from the house.

R13J75HBSNLFRV,"Two main things. On the front of the box it says 'Solar Generator' but no solar lead included. Very strange. It has a 12 volt cig lighter charger, a 240 lead mains charger, bit you have to buy your own solar panel cable and connectors. Second thing is it is adapted from the European or USA model where the 230 volt pure sine waver comes out. In Europe and USA it comes straight out, but for the uk, the plug lead exits at the bottom of the plug, meaning it can put pressure on the plug lead unless you raise it. Plug should be fitted  to 90 degrees to allow clearance, though as a lithium battery you can lay it down on its back. Third .... I know I said two, but there is a third, the lack of a usb c 3 and pd 3 usb connector would be useful these days. It only has two usb A 5v 2.4A plugs which is great for most connections, not super fast, but great. Good though is it comes with an MPPT solar controller built in and a pure sine wave inverter. Fab. I understand, yet to try, that the 12 volt, 10 amp cig lighter continously gives the correct voltage and does not drop, which is great. Will test that out, means I can use my portable 12 volt fridge without it cutting out when it drops below 12.2 volts.All in all a great little unit. Some tweakes would make it truly Fab.",5,10/08/2023,United Kingdom
R1FKW0ZROCVGSG,"Jackery Portable Power Station Explorer 240, Oct 2022] Arrived the next day which was a nice surprise. Switched it on and it was already on 48% power, which seemed a bit odd. I then boosted it up to 100%.The main purpose of buying it was to power my home (standard type) router in case of a power cut - we get a few round here. i.e. I need to keep the internet on 24/7. Early tests indicate that the battery can run itself PLUS the router for 1hr 45 mins on 10% (i.e. dropped from 100% to 90%). I'm pleased with this as I'm not expecting a power cut of more than 3-4 hours.In a separate test – my Android phone was on 1%, powering it up to 85% [plus powering the Jackery itself] took 7% of the Jackery’s energy. This used more energy than I was expecting, but acceptable. Recharging the phone is usually rapid, this time it was quite slow.I am expecting (hoping) - if I have to face a 4-hour power cut – I’ll manage easily to recharge (1) a laptop (2) a couple of mobile phones (3) a portable light and (4) power the router. With a bit of luck the Jackery will last for 5 or 6 years of occasional use (I'll try and ensure optimal conditions), but I may be being optimistic - we'll see. I will update if any further developments.July 2024: It's still working, but only had cause to use it once seriously (though I have done 3 or 4 tests to check it is still working OK). I appreciate the peace of mind having it.",5,08/10/2022,United Kingdom

I am an aviation enthusiast, I go to airports and log aircraft registrations (Tail-numbers) of aircraft I have seen.  The Jackery 240 is now a complete game changer for me.  Before the Jackery, I took my laptop, and lots of spare batteries as it runs a program via a radar box that runs a ""virtual radar"" on screen of aircraft around me for about 60 miles all around. I can see what is approaching from miles away, landing, taking off and overhead at cruising altitude and it records what I have seen. I have plugged my Laptop, which is also powering my USB powered ""Radar Box"" into the Jackery using the 12v outlet as a simulated test as a totally remote unit, as it would be if I was in the field at Myrtle Avenue (Hounslow, Heathrow) before I can finally get out for real after lockdown, and down to Heathrow for a days spotting.I am pleased to say that the 12v car charger running my laptop and ""Radar Box"" at a combined constant drain rate of 28w, using 10% of the Jackery power per hour, which is around 8 hours, down to the last 20% of the Jackery battery and as a bonus if my laptop battery is 100% charged before I start, that will give me an extra 2 hours once the Jackery gets down to its bottom 20%. That is a full days spotting, and if the weather is sunny, I have a 120w fold out Solar panel to keep the Jackery topped off for extended use for a few more hours, especially if my laptop, etc is drawing 28w and the Solar input is around 60wOverall, I am very impressed, a fantastic piece of kit.  I will be also getting the Jackery 500, when funds allow.",5,06/04/2021,United Kingdom

R2IA3XHQ9G7PL4,"It's a sunny day so is pulling in 32w at half 9 in the morning and charging well, was given full charge by the plug on arrival to ensure working sufficiently. This is the baby of the jackery family and charging 2 power bricks drained it to 45% quicker than I thought it would but it left me with enough to charge phone and tablet on top, and the power bricks fully charged to use when I'm down on power. I'm thinking I am going to need a bigger version of this for when I go off on my travels but as a back up the explorer 240 does what it says on the tin. You definitely need a solar panel over 100w though tried a smaller mobile one and got nothing in charge. Delivery is by yodel though and that's the only reason Ive given this 4 stars as didn't arrive on time and I had to chase yodel myself to figure out where it was. Jackery itself gets 5 stars.",4,20/04/2023,United Kingdom

R2ECPPAZBRHUS8,"For a while, I've been wanting to try one of these so called ""portable power stations"" in my home audio set-up, so I finally took the plunge.I've had the Explorer 240 for about a week, during which time, I've been exclusively using the AC output. So far, I've only completed one charge-discharge cycle, running the remaining charge down to 14% with 7:10 use with a 17W load, plus 1:55 with a 49W load - that comes to about 216Wh from 86% of the unit's capacity, which is consistent with the manufacturer's claims.In absolute terms, it's hardly lightweight, at 3kg, but considering the number of cells inside it, that weight is tolerable and besides, for me, it's a non-issue because mine is a static application.My only niggle, at this stage, is the fan noise, which can be intrusive when listening to music. To be fair, it's probably no louder than the fan noise from a typical desktop PC when it's doing something a bit more strenuous than just web browsing, and it's easy enough to resolve; I just need to use an extension cable and I can put the unit in the next room and close the door.I'm pretty happy I took the plunge.",4,22/05/2021,United Kingdom
R21I4M10I4W9GE,"I was in a rush for a new generator as ours stopped working a few days before we were due to go camping. The reviews on the Jackery were great and I’m really glad we opted for this compared to a few others we looked at! It’s was a great bit of kit that was in constant use for 4 days - charging 3 phones, 4 iPads and the odd use for the kettle and evening use for the lamp we had. I charged it to 100% before leaving and it was on 3% on our return. The screen is clear and you can turn off/on the different terminals using the light up buttons adjacent to the plugs/USB ports.There is an in car charger, which we didn’t have to use, but is handy to have. Jackery were really great when I contacted them, I asked if it could be shipped ASAP and they responded first thing the next morning to say they had shipped it and the estimated arrival date had changed for it to arrive in time for our trip. I can’t recommend this enough for light family use when camping - I’m not sure how it would stand up for heavier use but definitely great for families.",5,31/08/2021,United Kingdom
R2QZ3SFXXXMSL6,"I've been after a portable battery for years to play my acoustic and amp outside. This hits the spot. I use a GSMINI ES1 and and Yamaha LS16 (passive piezo pick up) both noise free; really impressed. I would estimate about 3-4 hours life as I plug in a small pedal board too using an extension lead from the Jackery to power amp and Pedals. 240 watt easily covers both. My Taylor 312CE ES2 does give a little ground hum, but usable with a bit of tweaking on EQ. Hope this helps the guitarists out there !!",5,18/01/2024,United Kingdom
R2LPIO8BILEYGV,"I've owned this for a few months now, I'll list the good and bad points.Good: it's robust, looks good, good handle, compact, easy to use.Bad: charger wires are flimsy and not suitable for the intended use. Charger gets stupidly hot. Inputs and outputs cables all protrude from the front, so vulnerable to damage.Overall, I do think this is worth the money if you can get it on a 60% sale dayEdit: as predicted the charger just stopped working, seems poorly made in comparison to the unit, not exactly fit for an expedition",3,03/04/2024,United Kingdom
RS7PHF12XCJG2,"Been a follower of ""Mr&Mrs Advanture, VanWives, Trent & Allie and Eamon & Bec"" I've seen the Jackery in action in  many Youtube blogs. I was very excited to get one with a standard UK plug and it hasn't disappointed !Its made camping trips just a little bit more comfortable, the jackery has 2 usb. one 12v socket and a 230v ac inverter 3 pin plug. Also has input for a solar panel to charge it as well. Each section has its own power on/off switch.  It was used for charge Laptops phones ipads and mini projector which it handle all easily, I was surprised how quickly  it charged at home but also from the 12v car charger.The LCD display is easy to read and gives you great information on how much power each device is using and work out how long it will last.On these also you can charge it while also having devices charging off it at the same time. Which others don't allow which seems like a good thing .All in all a great product won't go away with out it, will probably get the larger unit next time as I've been surprised by some appliances power consumption needs.",5,08/06/2021,United Kingdom
R1VW3EGEUMV5TI,Reviewed in conjunction with the solar panel additionI'm really happy with this. It's expensive and so is the solar panel but it is very well made ( get what you pay for? ) and it appears to work really well.Early days but I'm getting 11w input with cloud ( output on my phone is about 7 ) so even with a cloud I appear to be making more than I lose by charging a mobile )When I plugged it into the mains I was getting about 64w input and I'm getting so far best of 69w input from the sun...so it appears to load it with more power from the sun than I get from my mains electricity when charging..Any shadow on the solar panel does have a significant and immediate effect on the input which seems logical but worth avoiding even a shadow on one corner...Would I buy it again if I had the choice to go back? YES I think it's great and a great addition to a leisure battery on my camper van..I decided to have this separate to adding solar to the van because it gives me more versatility and so if we just want to go camping with a tent we could still easily power a portable cool box and pump up Paddle boards with an electric pump.,5,23/06/2021,United Kingdom
R1Q992U6HGTFNS,Worked well at first but by the time we arrived at our camping destination there was no charge despite fully charged before. I maybe had a dud. Returned for a full refund - returns process wasn't as straight forward as other Amazon purchases though. Probably good if you need a 3 pin plug source but for what I needed I now have 2 smaller battery packs instead with the same amount of power.,4,02/11/2023,United Kingdom

R3692MVPDJ5VI0,"As a camper and now a motor home owner I have been interested in portable energy for many years and remember reading about the Jackery products when they were first released in the USA. When I heard that Jackery were now selling though Amazon UK I was very interested in purchasing one but cautious at the same time. Nevertheless I decided to purchase the base 240 model as a test run. Without a doubt I'm very satisfied it's a great piece of equipment, well built, light and very easy to use. I've managed to test it on the beach running a cool box, charging phones, computers, camera batteries and so fourth with excellent results. I even utilised the 230v port with a battery charger to top up a 35amp battery I needed running between 136v to 178v on the monitor which it coped with ease. With the rounded smooth edges and it easy to hold handle and overall performance I have only found one fault, that is with me for not trusting myself and purchasing a Jackery 500 or 1000. I think I will go back to Amazon and think about a further purchase. Thank you Jackery for bringing it to the UK.",5,21/05/2021,United Kingdom

That said it's a good bit of kit with everything you need on it for the size.  I use it to run my 12v Fridge/ Freezer which will run for 23 hours down to 6%, and charger mobile phones etc. You can run almost anything up to a maximum of 200w.I'm very pleased with my purchase,  would I buy again?  If I hadn't already got a bigger one I would go for the higher wattage, a 1000w or so, then you can boil a 600w kettle etc. But it depends on what you want it for.",5,25/08/2023,United Kingdom
RT99P2P1W9IOQ,I love this product. It does exactly what you want it to do. I used it for camping. Blows up the beds and powers the fridge for a while. I had hoped it would powers the fridge for the weekend but really only lasts a day. I should have bought the next size up but space is a premium and it’s quite expensive. I’ve supplemented with a solar panel but do wish I’d gone for the bigger /more powerful version…,4,02/08/2023,United Kingdom
R2B6T9PXRLCIMK,"Great power station, came in 3 days,much earlier than expected. Has 2 usb. one 12v socket and a 230v ac inverter 3 pin plug. Also has input for a solar panel to charge it as well. Each section has its own power on/off switchCame 25 percent charged. Took 3.5 hrs to get up to 100 percent  on mains ac.I like the input and output power on the display so you can see how much power each device  is using and work out how long it will last.On these also you can charge it while also having  devices charging off it at the same time. Which others don't allow which seems like a good thing .especially  if its being charged by solar I guess.Comes with 2yr warranty and extra year if you register it .so 3 yrs.Has grips on base so it won't slide about.Plugged  mini fridge in ac 63w,then plugged  into 12v dc and used 54w, so the ac inverter  uses about 9w to convert to ac.

R2FZ5UCCCJXDX1,I purchased this as I am a magician and do outside events.  I needed something that could power my microphones and laptop.  I have a speaker that is battery charged already.  This combo allows me to perform outside for hours without the need for electric hook up.  For what I need it is PERFECT.BUT:-  I would say that for anything else it's not great.  This is the lower end of the spectrum in terms of power output.  If you can I would invest more money and buy maybe the Jackery 500 or 1000.  Personally I have come across a lot of items that I cannot use my 240 for that I could have used if I had purchased the 1000 model.

I can run the LED lights for night after night and can charge my phone or bluetooth speaker etc. It was all very straight forward to use, I like that the display shows you the power consumption too so you can see how power hungry what you are plugging in is.",5,14/06/2022,United Kingdom

All charging is done via the barrel connector which can also be used with a solar-cell array.Not especially heavy and with a comfortable handle, it's easy to move. All the reviews I've seen suggest use the USB and 12V outputs if possible, as there's an overhead of about 7W when converting to 240V.This display shows battery state and power draw.With the possibility of power cuts this winter, I wanted something to run the aquarium heaters and air-pumps for several hours and this looks ideal to deliver up to 200W.",5,08/11/2022,United Kingdom

R3U2GWZ772AILT,"I’ve had my Jackery 240 for a few months now and found it to be an excellent bit of kit. I bought one to use when I take my touring caravan off grid to charge phones, iPads and run a 12 volt TV. Doing this takes a some of the power demands away from the caravan leisure battery and so I don’t have to keep worrying every time I charge my phone. The Jackery took around four days to deplete and was used daily. I’ve got a small solar panel that I could charge it up with if I was staying longer. My only regret is that for my needs, I should have gone for the 500 watt version but the 240 is great, especially if you can charge it from solar panels whilst away.

We bought the smallest version of the Jackery as it was light to carry and easy to store in a small space. The only problem was the 3 pin socket was rather low to plug British appliances in. We got around this by using an adapter, but I suppose you could put something under the front edge to lift it slightly. We were able to charge it the next day from our onboard battery which is charged via our solar panel. Solar panels are available from Jackery for use with this unit.

Going camping soon with a electric hookup so I’d thought I’d get one when they were on offer.I understand that the main 240/110 outlet is interchangeable for different types of lug and voltages around the word but why on earth put It where is is. 12v the same around the world. UK plug sockets have a wire coming out of the bottom of the plug. Come on Jackery swap the 12v over with the 240 outlet in the next model.,4,19/07/2022,United Kingdom

Started on 100% and by the end of the week only dropped to 30% with every day use, I think at a push it could do 7 or 8 days before recharging.Really worth the expense and really handy size, with the option to charge it from the car if you have any daily trips planned.",5,13/10/2022,United Kingdom

I had already checked this was charged - I fully charged it in December and by February it was still at 100% - result. Router and wifi hub plugged into this with an extension cable for the extra sockets, and I was back online.

Also the display shows you the power out.  The Jackery supports pass though charging.  With four out let’s I powered many devices at the same time and the Jackery handled it with ease.  It also has a power meter that shows the battery percentage, very useful as not all solar generators are able to do this.  I haven’t looked at solar at the moment, but if the portable panel is as good as the power station, I want one.  Well when I can afford it.

Having looked at jackery reviews and against other batteries seemed like a reliable company selling a genuine product. And I am so happy with it ..  from flat takes about a night to completely charge on mains and can easily used it for hours at a time charging my phone and with the lights on in my van. The battery’s shows how many watts it is currently powering which allows you to easily adjust how you use it if it getting low.

R3PZP1VVHOG9GQ,I bought this to be able to simply be run broadband and phone in the result of a power cut - especially as we now have digital voice that requires power for the phone to work unlike the old analogue lines. Tested recently when we had some electrical work done that switched off the power for about 6 hours and kept the internet and phone alive with around 30% battery left. Seems very well made and would definitely consider a larger model for camping or more off grid activities.,5,23/12/2022,United Kingdom

While I’ve only had it a few months, it holds charge well and is perfect for light use. Good that you can recharge in various ways too. And unlike a dedicated leisure battery it has the benefit of being able to take it out the van / use in the garden etc. too.I got this with a view to getting a higher capacity version for some more off-grid trips away / wild camping.

I charge from another generator, and it works well.  The only omission is a usb C port but easily overcome with an adapter.  It more than powers what I wanted it for - charging laptop, phone etc and it also runs my projector for about 4 hours.  Incredibly happy with my Black Friday purchase.  Normal price is a bit expensive and would have stopped me buying.",5,13/01/2022,United Kingdom
R1Z9HP61ZQBQ2E,"Now I've waited to use the 240 before reviewing, used it 5/6 times now and it's far better than I expected, can charge a phone 20 times, holds charge, will charge my drone and control 7 times and can charge several things at once, got it coz I live in a van and this means I'll off grid far longer, cracking product I mean it won't power a blender so those of you looking for margaritas on the beach might need a bigger unit but for my use case bangin!!",5,01/06/2022,United Kingdom
RZ83JCOYFS2D0,"I purchased this unit as I was going on a camping trip and the site has no electricity. I have to use a CPAP machine to sleep at night, the unit can run the CPAP for over 3 nights from 1 charge. I also purchased the Solar panel which can recharge the Jackery in 5 hours, meaning I did not have to risk charging the Jackery from my car battery. The unit is very small, light weight and has multiple charging functions which is a massive bonus. I would highly recommend this product!",5,20/07/2022,United Kingdom
RFBKB7UDZUXZA,"I took the Jackery 240wh Power Station on a weekend 'Wild Camping' trip with the family.  It supplied all the power needed to charge multiple phones, torches and camera batteries for the weekend and was relatively light (but I only had to walk half a mile from the car to the camping area).I purchased the unit to be able to charge it from my shed roof solar panel and after buying a 8mm barrel plug to solar panel cable MC4 converter was able to charge the unit within a few hours only a moderately sunny day in April.Overall a nice piece of kit and I hope to use it for longer periods over the summer months",5,04/06/2021,United Kingdom
RDTHWYT0X3N69,Excellent power station really well built but a bit pricey if it had been cheaper I would have bought the bigger size the 500 or 1000  as this one will just last a weekend with careful use unless you have solar panel to recharge so ideal if only needing for couple of days and don’t have a big demand on it,5,30/06/2023,United Kingdom
R3DT7RODTTWZLT,"Like a lot of people, I realised that having some electrical back up during a power cut is really important after living through Storm Eunice earlier this year.  This won't keep your house running but it will let you charge your phone and run a laptop, router or boil a kettle. I'm taking it camping soon to keep the beer box cool!  Not cheap but I expect everything like this has gone up in price and there's not a lot of decent second hand stuff either",5,21/06/2022,United Kingdom
R2LKBZPO3M1UI,"Bought to support charging needs during camping trips, the expectations were merely for phones and cameras. Yet the little 240 kept the fridge going for 5 hours. The versatility and portability will have you finding solutions to problems you never knew existed; power wherever you need. Plus, the 240 is genuinely small and light enough to be placed into a backpack or bag, this picnics and beaches can become kitchens, work stations, or offices, whatever you need. I opted to purchase a solar panel too, which has performed equally as well.",5,12/04/2022,United Kingdom
RNH9EUMZI9JK9,"This is a fantastic piece of kit. I have it for a low tech van conversion. It has everything built in such as inverters etc. It is idiot proof (I'm an idiot with technology and its been fool proof!).It lasts for days on end  I run LED lights and charge my phone every day before I need to re-charge. My only niggles are how small the button is next to each power option.  Plus the 3 pin plug is low on the unit, so the plug cable can bump the surface. These would not put me off buying it at all.Buy one!",5,15/08/2021,United Kingdom
R39EVKE3ED2BSR,"This product is amazing and I am so pleased I bought it! I just need to get a solar panel to charge it up when away for more than a weekend so won’t need to use electricity then!

RYV2ERMAG3O5E,"As someone who has never had any kit like this, I read the facts, the reviews and re-read the description. I brought this to run my electric cool box and it's described and clearly stated in the manual that a 60W coolbox could be run for 19 hours. Well, it lasted just over 4 hours, not even enough to keep it going overnight with no solar charge! Now I get that to find out how long things last, you divide 240 by whatever the power consumption is on your device. So 240 divided by 58 is 4.1 so it will last 4.1 hours. Know this before you buy. Other than that, it's a good high quality piece of kit.",3,21/08/2022,United Kingdom

When I complained to them I didn’t really get a satisfactory response.",5,27/10/2022,United Kingdom
R35KW9K12C2LZB,"The power pack is ok. Although not suitable for me as I wanted to run my gas boiler which is only 100w. Unfortunately the unit has a floating ground which my boiler wont accept and therefore wont ignite. Their support team were unable to assist.Return process was fine, until they confirmed receipt. Then I was told it would take 4 business days to process my refund. OK, no problem; but a week went by and still no refund. I raised an Amazon A-Z claim and that's when the fun started. Repeat requests for me to cancel my claim as the funds were stuck with Amazon. Suffice to say I refused and told them to take it up with Amazon. Amazon refunded me and I'm grateful for their support. I purchased a Bluetti unit (which also initially didn't work my boiler) and their support team confirmed I could create a Neutral - Ground bond and the unit worked perfectly. So, in short, product probably good, but aftersales support poor and Customer Service terrible.",2,14/11/2022,United Kingdom

R2ISHNAQJGIBWG,"I had this Jackery for a few months and if you're staying somewhere overnight then it's absolutely fantastic. It's very well made and the integrated handle is very useful. You can also charge the device with a Solar Panel if you're going off-grid, however the charging is limited so be aware of this.It can power your phones and tablets for a very long time. If you're wanting to run something like a coolbox for more than a couple of hours, then you will need to get a Jackery with a larger battery.",5,26/10/2021,United Kingdom

R1ZB9XKMR1ZZV3,"These gloves are excellent! I originally bought them for 3D printing, as many companies recommend nitrile gloves when handling 3D-printed resins. When working with resin, especially liquid resins and Isopropanol alcohol, it is crucial to have reliable gloves, and these do the job perfectly. The fit is incredible; they feel like a second skin, making tasks like removing supports from 3D prints a breeze. The textured surface ensures a firm grip, even when handling slippery or delicate objects, while their stretchability enhances dexterity and control. Whether you are working with intricate parts or handling liquids, these gloves give you a secure and confident hold.While I initially expected them to be thinner due to the price, I was pleasantly surprised. They are thick enough to offer serious protection but not so thick that they limit movement. I have used them with both liquid resin and Isopropanol, and they have never torn, punctured, or shown any signs of degradation during use. Their puncture resistance is a significant advantage, especially when working with sharp tools or rough materials.Although I originally bought these for single use, they are definitely strong enough to be reused multiple times, depending on the task. If I am just cleaning or doing light work, I wash them with soap while still wearing them, turn them inside out to dry, and they are good to go for another use. This makes them even more cost-effective. We always keep a box of these gloves in the house, as they are perfect for everything from scrubbing the oven and cleaning the toilet to handling my cat's litter tray, food preparation, first aid, or any task that requires thorough hand protection. I recently started using them when cleaning my water filtration system to avoid contamination, and they work perfectly for that as well.The fit is excellent too. I have large hands, and the large size fits me well, though they are slightly tight, which I prefer because it gives me more control over what I am doing. I would estimate they are about a size 9, which is perfect for my hands. They are also latex-free, so they do not irritate my skin at all, which is a huge bonus for anyone with allergies or sensitivities.Another great feature is how easy they are to put on and take off. Even after wearing them for an extended period, they do not stick to my skin, and there is no hassle when it comes to removing them. I have had gloves in the past that became difficult to remove after long use, but not these.For £5.75 for a box of 100 large gloves, the value for money is outstanding. The quality is on par with, if not better than, more expensive brands I have tried. The packaging was sturdy and secure, and you can actually remove one glove at a time from the box without pulling out a clump. These gloves are definitely some of the best I have used. If you are looking for reliable, durable, and versatile nitrile gloves for any task, whether it is 3D printing, cleaning, food prep, or messy jobs around the house, I cannot recommend these highly enough!Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I hope that you found it helpful and that it assists you in your decision-making. I try to be as honest and fair as possible, as those have always been the reviews that helped me the most.",5,28/09/2024,United Kingdom

RIM3GEWRRTBYE,"Good quality, only one glove has ripped while putting it on. I bought these for domestic use...chopping meat, cleaning cat tray, general cooking prep, clearing out the Dyson when full etc.  As a daily user of PPE at work I feel I know good and bad quality gloves when I use them, and these gloves in my view are good quality and would recommend. My only concern is that the box is not in any packaging and Amazon dispatch just put their shipping sticker on the box. This is not a problem for me but if you need the gloves for clinical use then just bear in mind that the box will be covered in microorganisms due to the delivery chain, regardless of any claim Amazon may make of of hygiene standards.

R31RLEAO2ZIK8M,"I'm always a little dubious about buying latex gloves, as I've found that the quality and fit can vary dramatically , so size L in one make may be a tight fit and another make too baggy. Higher prices don't necessarily reflect quality & quantity, so I was pleasantly surprised when I first use this make. Having ""normal sized"" hands, I found size L are a good fit and easy to get on and off with this make. As I use them mainly for working on car car or boat engines, I'm happy if they last for one job, as they will be usually be pretty mucky by the time I finish so consider them as one-use disposable. These seem reasonably rugged, but I've yet to find nitrile gloves that that are not prone to snagging when used for mechanical work although they seem more rugged than latex gloves - I doubt that is a problem when used for medical or other less demanding purposes. Good value for 100 gloves.",5,27/12/2024,United Kingdom

R3TWFPFY563AGG,"I've never had these gloves tear on me at all, they're a pretty good quality; I've ordered them a few different times.If you have eczema or any skin condition, I would highly recommend them. I haven't found any aggravating layer or powder inside, nothing on it has bothered my skin, and unlike rubber gloves they maintain a strong sense of tactility. If you are using them for eczema however I would highly recommend wearing a pair of cotton gloves inside of them, to prevent the sweat build-up from aggravating your skin.If you ARE an eczema sufferer in particular, or have easily irritated skin, try wearing these when you wash your hair. I like to apply a layer of zinc cream (a.k.a., nappy cream) inside of the gloves sometimes, to add an extra layer of protection for my skin, and then I wash my hair etc. After any business involving soap or SLS-containing products is done in the shower or bath I then take off the gloves and wash my hands clean with an eczema friendly soap or aqueous cream. :)I've never had these gloves tear on me either. I recommend them highly. It WOULD be nice if they were just a little longer, though, up the wrist to prevent leaking inside (e.g., for this reason they can be less than ideal for washing dishes). But they're otherwise very good.",5,11/11/2024,United Kingdom

I'm wondering if these 2 packs are old stock that was at the back of the warehouse as I never had this problem before with any gloves, this brand or others. At first I thought I'd just caught my glove on something but nope. It's not enough of them to warrant complaining and asking for my money back, but I am considering changing my order in future to a different type.I'm still giving 4 stars as usually this brand is great, but if this turns out to be more of a problem than just those 2 boxes I may come back and change that.",4,05/11/2024,United Kingdom

R3UAA3KRP98P7M,I measured up my hand and it suggested I needed XS so that’s what I orderedUnfortunately they were far too small for me so have re-ordered the size small insteadWhen I did try the XS they are extremely tough gloves and didn’t split when I tried to squeeze them onI have the size small coming today so will update this review laterApart from sizing though these are definitely excellent and very tough glovesHighly recommendedUPDATE:I have just received these in size small and they are absolutely a perfect fit for my female hands. I am using these when I paint using oils or acrylic.  Absolutely love themUPDATE 2:These are extremely strong disposable gloves.  My new small size fits nice and tightly so I don’t have any ‘feel’ problems; it’s just like wearing no gloves at all.  They are absolutely perfect for using during my artistic work,5,30/12/2024,United Kingdom

RKGJ2YOS75OWI,Great quality and price.,5,09/03/2025,United Kingdom
RLDMPO7HHLDYQ,First of all. If you're looking for large go for one size up because they are more like a medium. They don't stretch very much at all. Having said that. The quality of the gloves themselves are good. They don't rip even when I struggle get them on my large hands.,4,07/01/2025,United Kingdom

R3A9LRJEDF2OX,Highly recommend,5,02/03/2025,United Kingdom
RE21C9NKT9SUH,"These gloves are high-quality, reliable, and great value for money. Highly recommend them for anyone in need of a multipurpose glove! Although I did find they were a bit too snug. I got them in medium and even though my hands are on the small side, these were a tad snug. However, I've not had any break while in use which is great.",5,20/01/2025,United Kingdom
RNKZH2XEQUUDC,"These gloves are a reasonable size,and,also fairly tough.You always wonder if,A,will they fit,or be tiny?,and B,will the material split.I find these gloves to be pretty good on both of those counts,a good product.",5,08/02/2025,United Kingdom
R2AN2T5Q9DSHXG,"I've tried many brands of nitrile gloves over the years, and they're all much of a muchness, so I usually just get the cheapest available when I need to restock. When I saw a box of Pearl gloves in the examination room at the vets, I made a mental note to try these next.I haven't noticed a big difference in terms of quality or durability, but they are comfortable enough, do their job well, and sizing is consistent (I have small hands but need to wear Medium to help prevent tearing).The main benefit is that they come in many different colours, which is more than just a gimmick - if you need to double-glove, you will more easily see if you get a tear in one. However, it's a shame that the price of some colour options are so much more expensive.",5,03/11/2024,United Kingdom
R1BMBKAS37Q0ZO,Its nice product but can bee stronger .Its not good for gardening,4,13/01/2025,United Kingdom
RU61SSGFV19IY,These gloves are excellent quality and fit really well. I have large hands and the large size gloves fit perfectly.They're powder free so they don't irritate my hands and are durable enough for all the scrubbing and cleaning I've been doing over the past few weeks.I'd highly recommend these gloves for any cleaning tasks. They're waterproof and have stood up.to the various cleaning products I've used without issue.,5,11/01/2025,United Kingdom

R1VM4MBMS5C4WM,When it comes to keeping your hands clean when you're painting models you go through a fair amount of disposable gloves.For the price I couldn't complain and they're definitely work as  intended.Will buy again,5,23/01/2025,United Kingdom

R3HZW7QGOBZ71C,"Using these for 3d resin printing, my hands are large-ish i guess, i ordered the XL size, and they are reasonably easy to get. strong enough that i have not yet poked a hole through any of them. So overall good value for money.",4,18/11/2024,United Kingdom

RZKTN67L9G606,They do the job but sometimes rip easy,3,11/03/2025,United Kingdom
R25ZSSPL62T9VA,"Overall, these are nitrile gloves (thin gauge) and they do what they are supposed to. They are free of powder, so you need to be sure you have the right size because they don’t stretch as well as latex and you will not get them on if they are even a little smaller than your hand.I bought medium thinking it’d fit my wife and maybe I could squeeze into a medium glove. For the width of fingers, I don’t think a medium will work for most men because they don’t stretch well and without the aid of any powder, the surface has too much friction to slide across skin when putting them on.",4,12/08/2024,United Kingdom
R2B3XK717J5KXB,"Exactly as expected. These are probably the best nitrile gloves on sale for a reasonable price. They are thick enough not to break but thin enough to still provide enough dexterity. I use them in the kitchen, when working on my car, when cleaning the house and anywhere I need some protection from harsh chemicals or dirt. They don't disappoint and I keep reordering them knowing I can expect consistent quality.EDIT: For some reason the black gloves are thicker than the blue gloves. Maybe it's just the batch I received as I have only ever bought the blue version once but won't be doing that again.",5,07/11/2024,United Kingdom

R36XTBW4EQYECM,"Good quality product, comfortable to wear and use, will buy again",5,05/02/2025,United Kingdom
RU1QADUQ9YLY9,"I needed some nitrile gloves to protect my hands & nails, keep them clean and be able to do fiddly jobs in the garden and for hygiene purposes. I have quite small hands but longish fingers and find that in a well known brand of rubber gloves, small is tight to remove and medium is baggy at the finger tips. So have only used medium nitrile gloves before again having the same baggy finger tip issue.I used the size guide on these gloves and small was my size so I gave it a try .....I am so pleased I did, these fit perfectly no baggyness and I can do more delicate tasks with ease. Chuffed to bits now!These black Nitrile gloves do exactly what I needed them for. Never had black before but for the sale price I cannot complain.These are thinner than others I have used but this may be because they fit ""like a glove"" and I am not feeling double on my finger tips. That being said, I do reuse these gloves until a hole appears and I have been able to reuse a pair for several days doing light pruning/deadheading in the garden before having to dispose of them.Recommend these and I will buy again.",5,14/05/2024,United Kingdom

R28JWRXO6E3LWR,Good colour to spot them in my under sink ‘bin’ - they’re decent quality (haven’t put my finger through them) and keep my hands dry and they have a bit of stretch in them - can be used quite a few times so also good value for money. I use them for dealing with manky stuff around the house/cleaning and dusting with microfibre cloths (they go right through me!). Would buy again - recommend,5,03/12/2024,United Kingdom
R2ICQAA6U6H393,"I use these gloves for anything from cleaning to avoid being covered in grease at work, to using them to protect my hands from spray paint.

R2TKWRV1A4KJVR,"I recently purchased a pair of Crocs Unisex Kids Classic Clogs for my child, and they have quickly become a favorite! These clogs are everything I hoped they would be—comfortable, stylish, and extremely practical.First off, the comfort level is exceptional. My child can wear these all day without any complaints. The material is soft and lightweight, making them perfect for running around at the park or just lounging at home. The cushioned footbed provides great support, which is important for little feet still growing.The durability of these clogs is impressive as well. They can handle all sorts of activities, from playing outside in the mud to splashing around at the pool. I've noticed they clean up easily, too—just a quick rinse and they're as good as new!I also love the variety of colors available. We went with a vibrant pink, and they look adorable! The classic design is versatile and pairs well with many outfits, making them suitable for casual outings, playdates, or even family gatherings.The ventilation holes are a great feature as well, allowing airflow to keep feet cool and preventing odor buildup. My child loves the ease of slipping them on and off, which encourages independence.Overall, I highly recommend the Crocs Unisex Kids Classic Clogs for any parent looking for a reliable, comfortable, and stylish footwear option for their little ones. They’re a fantastic investment, and my child loves them! I’ll definitely be purchasing more pairs in the future!",5,11/10/2024,United Kingdom

R1VOEKMC1XN0A0,"My daughter decided she wanted crocs for holidays instead of sliders, the cheapest I found them in her size was amazon and I was a little worried as I know sometimes sellers sell fakes on amazon so usually try not to buy branded stuff but as I had prime I decided to give it a go and send back if they weren't legit.  They were the real deal, I fully checked them out, ensuring they were in the proper bag on delivery and the correct labels and all the badges on them were legit so all in all a good purchase as they were about 25% cheaper than the regular shops",5,30/08/2024,United Kingdom
R1U1KJZB47ZBJD,"Sizing for these is confusing, hope this helps. According to the chart, J4 corresponds to EU36-37, uk size 3.5-4. I’d say these are a uk3.5 to small 4 - my (size uk4) toe is touching the end, and heel is only just inside the rear ridge; with the rear strap in use, they are a little snug but I mostly use them without. I’d say if you’re slightly over a uk 4, or want to wear with thick socks or a liner, J4 will be too small. No need to size up for wide feet.",5,13/10/2024,United Kingdom
R3HDZ61686X4NI,Ordered these in a size 13 for my sister as that's the size she wears in all kinds of shoes however these are pretty small fitting so I don't think they're going to last very long before they're too small :( delivery was also delayed by 3 days which wasn't ideal as I needed them the day before they actually arrived. Other than this the quality is great and colour is pristine so if you're looking to purchase I would definitely recommend sizing up so that they're longer lasting!,4,11/07/2024,United Kingdom

Luckily, I happened to find a shop that had various sizes, just not the 'classic' style, which enabled me to figure out what size she needed.  Although she is between a 3 and 4, the adults ones always come up quite wide.

RMQEO6KNX2DSU,"Brilliant bit of kit.I use the power bank when I'm out flying my drones, so i can keep charged out on the go. Since ive been using it its never ran out on me while ive been out, the capacity is great. Both the power bank and dock have excellent build quality and feel like they could take a beating. Anker have also included an app that helps you monitor your charging and also gives a few extra features like power saving modes where the device will charge at a slower rate between low usage times to improve battery life.The dock is a fantastic addition to have on your desk. (where mine lives) its multi function of both a charger for your power bank but also the addition of two USBC ports and a single USB port give it useful functionality besides just doing one or the other.Unfortunately like many other manufacturers they have decided to add that textured feel design along the sides of the power bank. meaning there are many small valleys and peaks where dust and dirt is attracted and then accumulates, if you work or take the device to dirty environments this can become frustrating as its not often the easiest to clean. not sure why manufacturers are obsessed with using this design. its not a big issue but i know it frustrates me so maybe it does others.",5,01/09/2024,United Kingdom
R1M6T5XV1Q6YWW,"Brilliant piece of kit from Anker. Design, functionality and build quality is excellent. A bit weighty, but forgivable for such a versatile power bank. It charged my Surface Book 2 through a small adaptor with no hassle whatsoever, something I was not able to do with my other units. Now I only need this and my GaN wall charger instead of different charging bricks. Recharge speed from a normal USB-c charger or wall socket is slow, which is expected but with a GaN charger at 100w it was a rapid process. This is a premium device and, in my opinion, well worth the money. A GaN 100w charger would be a worthwhile investment, along with 100w capable cables, which would complement this outstanding piece of kit.",5,14/10/2024,United Kingdom
RU4GUT73IW68V,"Having this amount of power in a completely portable box is super handy. It has more than enough capacity to fully charge my MacBook (and at full speed too) with spare juice for other things.Build quality is great and I appreciate the inclusion of the soft bag to store it in. It has been crashing around in the bottom of my bag for months and doesn’t have any damage. It is pretty heavy, but if you want a battery this huge, you signed up for it.The screen is a bit of a gimmick but gives you peace of mind that you’re getting full speeds. The app is even more excessive but I suppose the “Find My” functionality might come in handy one day.Stays fairly cool during both charging and discharging at full speed. My unit is still at 100% capacity after 6 months of usage which is promising.Definitely recommend if you need a fast and high capacity power bank for working on the go.",5,07/10/2024,United Kingdom
R12Y6N4BULH0ZJ,"Fast charging and discharging, it easily powers my MacBook (65 watts) , S23 Ultra (45 watts)  and iPhone 15 Pro (29 watts) at full speed at the same time without getting anywhere near the insane 250 watts maximum discharge it is advertised to be capable of. The power bank itself is the largest you can take on an aeroplane without explicit permission from the airline (This stores 99.5 watt hours of energy, the maximum allowed is 100 watt hours).The bluetooth connected app is good and you can input the battery size of your devices to get an accurate indication of how many times the Power Bank can charge these devices before running flat. This is displayed on the powerbank's screen to view whenever needed.A nice surprise compared to my old Anker 737 is that this allows pass through charging so you can charge the powerbank and also any devices connected to it at the same time.I have just finished charging this power bank from 0 to 100 percent with two cables to get close to the max charging speed of 170 watts,  one from a 100 watt charger , and another from my laptop charger which charges at 65 watts. It surprisingly did not get too warm, maxing out at 41c during its torture test, in normal scenarios with one cable I barely see higher than ambient temperature.Using two cables, I managed a charge time from 0 to 94 percent in 32 minutes and  0 to 100 percent in 37 minutes (it slows down to 64 watts charging when almost full).A fully charged power bank will charge your iPhone 15 Pro 5.4 times or a S23 Ultra 3.6 timesDefinitely recommended if you travel a lot and in need of constant power that can be replenished quickly, but it is expensive (£150)",5,19/12/2023,United Kingdom
R3DLX0TD0L921D,"Super powerful and charges laptops, tablets, cameras phones (basically anything) with juice to spare.My only gripe is that the front panel is like a glossy plastic; it looks great but I know as soon as I put it face down on a surface it'll scratch horribly. I don't think its a tough glass, I think its only plastic but I wont use it without it being in the little soft pouch it comes with as I'm certain it will instantly scratch up.Maybe if it had a raised plastic lip around the edge but as it is I have to take the pouch everywhere which is a bit of a faff that I dont have to do with any other battery bank.Basically its really good value for money but I wish I could be a little more 'rough' with it.",4,29/09/2024,United Kingdom

RS8N7Y4US1JR6,"It’s an Anker product so need I say more when it comes to quality, if you’re new to Anker they have great quality products across their range, which includes charging cables, power banks, charging hubs and portable power stations when you’re off camping. I bought this as an upgrade for my ageing Anker power bank and it’s worth the money, the screen and associated app shows you charging speeds and what not, is really cool to see and the performance is great, it will charge your devices as fast as is safely possible, also for laptop users it can charge at 140-170w depending on how many cables you use to charge so it’s full speed charging on those too. It’s a little bit on the bulky side but it easily fits inside my backpack to go abroad and for those travelling by plane it is within the international aviation regulations for safe carriage of batteries so no need to get prior approval before taking it abroad.",5,04/06/2024,United Kingdom
R3RWU92R3TRPXD,"This is not a great power bank.  For the price point, there are potentially better options.Pros:Charges quickly if you have an adequate charger.Charges quickly if you have the optional dockHigh output chargingCons:User interface is horrendous - switching to trickle charge/bluetooth activation/menu options.  It’s not intuitive and is frustrating to useHeavy brick3 outputsMassively overpriced (even at discount)Fingerprint magnetAdditional cost for charging dockBluetooth connectivity can be an issueSeems to drain very quickly - Anker Solix devices are a better option at price point (however may not be suitable for travel such as air travel/travelling light)I usually like Anker products, but I regret buying this device.  I don’t really think that it is fit for purpose, and think there are many sponsored reviews that are ‘bigging’ this up, when it is actually not worth the outlay, with far better options at similar price points.I would consider an Anker Solix c200 as a better alternative to this unit if you don’t need to take your power bank on a plane or are less concerned about bulk.I really cannot recommend this device in all honesty.  I still have mine, but I kind of wish I didn’t.  I think that the reliability is questionable and there are better options available.",1,15/03/2025,United Kingdom

R2B81LIMCSKNIY,"This power bank is an absolute beast!  I've had the Anker Prime 27,650mAh for almost a year now, and it's become my trusty companion on every trip and outing.Here's what I love about it: * Ultra-Fast Charging:  With two USB-C ports and a USB-A port, I can juice up my PS Portal, phone, Switch, and other devices simultaneously at lightning speed. No more fighting over charging cables! * Massive Capacity: This thing is a tank! The 27,650mAh capacity means I can go days without needing to recharge the power bank itself. Perfect for long journeys or festivals. * Durable Build: It's a bit bulky, but that's because it's built like a tank. I've accidentally dropped it a few times, and it's still going strong without a scratch. * Anker Charging Base (a MUST BUY!):  Grab the Anker charging base for this – it charges the power bank back up insanely fast. Seriously, it's a game-changer. * Bluetooth and App Connectivity: The Anker app is surprisingly useful. You can monitor battery levels, customize charging settings, and even update the firmware (which I highly recommend, as it improved my battery life).A couple of minor niggles: * Fingerprint Magnet: The glossy front panel attracts fingerprints like crazy. But hey, that's a small price to pay for such an awesome power bank.Overall, the Anker Prime 27,650mAh is an absolute winner. If you're looking for a reliable, powerful, and feature-packed portable charger, look no further. You won't be disappointed!",5,02/01/2025,United Kingdom
R3IKKAJOJQF9A9,"As an avid Anker consumer, I've amassed quite the collection of Anker products over the years, I'd been considering this for a while and I finally bit the bullet. I've only had this less than 24 hours but I'm already impressed. The build quality is phenomenal, the speed it can recharge is insane, almost 40 minutes from 0-100% using the matching dock and a separate anker 100w wall charger. It can easily power my laptop, phone and tablet at the same time without breaking a sweat.It's a little heavy but to be expected for something with this kind of capacity and punch.In short, absolutely delighted and don't regret my investment!",5,11/02/2025,United Kingdom
R1UUSEKHUC0ZSV,"I have a couple of power banks for charging devices when out and about, and I recently bought a MacBook so I wanted something as an emergency to keep it going if needed. When this arrived I was impressed it's well made and the digital display is great at giving you all of the information you need. It's a chunky charger that is easy to carry around but isn't light.I fully charged it and ran down the 2024 M4 MacBook Pro to 10%. I plugged in the charger and it got to 86% on the MacBook before it was empty. It was quite quick at doing this and is a good piece of kit.However, for me, unless speed was the goal, I didn't need to spend this much as there were much cheaper power banks that would charge my MacBook. Maybe not as quick and slightly less power. But enough to warrant not paying as much.All in all, it's a good piece of kit, but bear in mind what you want to charge from it: phones and anything else like that its going to be fantastic.",3,05/02/2025,United Kingdom

I bought mainly to use for my 4080 laptop to make it more mobile instead of using mains power. It powers the laptop but unfortunately will only last around an hour before the power bank is drained completely. I then have to use the laptop battery which also only last about an hour. So, just over 2 hours & both would be drained to 0. So I can give it 4 stars as it does what is says but which it held more battery life at the high end drain.",4,10/11/2024,United Kingdom

R1081U10F95QET,This is everything I need. Powers my laptop for hours - not long enough to go totally discharged. The laptop pulls between 10 and 40 watts based on a led cable with a display.This should run tablets for many many hours quite easily. It'll recharge phones in a jiffy. I've tried it on my S24 phone. Totally nice.I can recharge it from a USB high-powered charger at about 66 watts which is quite good enough. Most times it never discharges more than 50%.It came with USB C cable and a nice soft bag which fits snuggly with a draw string. But highly recommended is a hard case as well. Got that. I overjoyed.Oh I had the previous lower powered model that went dead. Anker as always stood by their produce with in the warranty period and refunded that one. So go this one as an upgrade for a few quid more.Great product Anker - great service. That's what build customer loyalty.Close your eyes and buy this.,5,11/11/2024,United Kingdom
R3B2YN7KW8TI7E,"I have the older, 24,000 mAh version of this charger and bought this one as a additional charger. Unfortunately, I have had some problems with it.I love Anker devices and buy them in preference to most brands. They are usually safe, reliable and well designed. This device is safe and well designed, but I didn’t find it reliable. The older power bank had one bidirectional USB C port for charging the power bank and for charging other devices, and a second USB C port just for charging other devices. For the new power bank both USB C ports are bidirectional. The advantage is that you can charge the power bank using either socket, which is less confusing. However, in practice, I quickly got used to which port to use with the older power bank. The disadvantage is that the new power bank gets confused it you want to use it to charge up a smaller device that also acts as a power bank. I have a number of devices, such as a magsafe power bank, that are designed to charge other items and on holiday, I frequently top them up with the older 24,000mAh Anker power bank. I couldn’t use this new power bank as it just wouldn’t charge them. I am thinking it was confused about which way charging was required. I understand there is a phone app that can be used to control the new power bank, which the old one didn’t have, but I don’t want to have to mess around with an app whenever I want to charge.Added to that, I found that the second USB socket came up with an overvoltage warning and stopped charging the power bank if I tried to charge it with a high power charger. Both this and the older power bank can be charged up to 140w, which is really quick. However, I found that the second USB C socket claims overvoltage and stops charging once the power exceeds 85w or so.This certainly won’t put me off Anker devices, as I have several and the others are great, but this one was returned for a refund. I suspect it wasn’t yet ready for release.",3,25/05/2024,United Kingdom

This product really struggles on low power draw items, it just can’t recognise below a certain amount and it just stops. The ports also struggle to differentiate between input and output (although you can’t change this on the app)Finally, if you look around, unless you absolutely NEED the capability to both charge the device and charge your own devices at 140w, this is a very expensive product. Even Anker do much cheaper alternatives with 100w charging.",3,18/01/2025,United Kingdom

This 27mah model is only half as much weight again, is not that much bigger and outputs well over twice as much power. It can cope with mulple devices at once. Better still the display can be changed to display volts, amps and watts. The app (which for some reason is not avalable for the smaller models) is a nice addition. With the optional (it isn't really that optional) base charger unit the 100W charge (only if nothing else if charging from the base frustratingly) fills this up in just under an hour (my old non-Prime 12mah battery took 6 hours!) If this isn't fast enough, plug in two 100W chargers and you'll easily halve this time. Talking of time, this also has the option to permanently display the time. Sturdy.

R36CK7EAO3TD9E,"I needed a power bank that could charge my drone batteries in the field and whilst on the move - It charges them at the max rate I get from my 200W wall charger (36W) and is only limited by the batteries ability to take the charge. It can charge all of the drone devices at once - so 2 batteries (one in the drone & the others in the hub) & the controller no problem. This setup allows my 5 batteries to be fully recharged from a single charge of the powerbank, so effectively gives me 10 batteries for a days use and another 5 batteries would be £300 and the powerbank was £150 and more versatile as I can charge any other mobile device. It re-charges fast if you have the power to re-fill it. I use my 200W mains charger which has 6 outputs, 2 are 65W max, 4 x 25W - but you can use the 2 USBC ports as inputs as well as outputs so if I plug in 2 high power USB C cables I can easily get 140W re-charge and then it can fully recharge the powerbank in an hour!! I love the built in display showing voltage, ampage etc - I usually use inline devices to get this info from my other power banks.

R7EWZWL3O6HT9,"My 737 powerbank died not too long ago, which was an unpleasant surprise, especially considering the outlay it demanded. Anyhow, having really found the fast charging (including the powerbank) extremely convenient, i decided to take my chances on this improved version. It's capacity of 99.54Wh is a 12Wh improvement over the 737, and is pretty much nearing the limit for travelling abroad. It takes noticeably longer to charge at the full 140W compared to the 737, but the fact it goes from 0-100 in less than an hour is really convenient.It seemed all sunshine and rainbows, and all set to go, until I noticed an extremely high pitched sound being emitted from the powerbank when its charging past 80%. Never come across something like this before, and when i say it's extremely high pitched, i'm talking about 16khz, and if you want to give that a listen, it's on youtube, but you'll probably thank me later for NOT doing that. It's very uncomfortable for my ears, and I can't imagine how bad it would be if you were suffering from tinnitus.Could be a faulty unit, but i'm sending my unit back. There's no way i'm going to be able to cope with about 10 minutes of that noise, every time i'm topping the powerbank back up (starts around the 80% mark for some reason). I have 2 140W apple chargers (one i got from CEX for £30) and it's able to charge right up to the 170W limit. This is all really enticing for someone who might have never tried a charger like this, but with the issue presented, it's a hard pass for me.Also, not liking where Anker have been heading with their prices - nearly 200 for a charger?!? I guess it's unique functionality of being able to be topped up within 50 mins, is a big plus, when other chargers would take a full night's length to charge fully, but it's not worth TWICE the amount of the 737 by all means!",3,07/12/2023,United Kingdom

Know how much is left based on the battery draw is insightful.I’m off to Singapore and Viatnam soon. This is coming with me every step of the way!",5,08/09/2024,United Kingdom
R34HQNM3KXLQ1L,"I am very happy with this product. Super easy to setup and to operate, I was amazed with the charging performance, from 0% it took less than an hour to charge to 100% from a fast charger (it was too quick for me to time).  It would be nice if they did one with a higher capacity as this is pricey, but in my opinion worth it.  I like the design even if it looks like a brick.... it’s an ergonomic brick and the digital display is good quality and bright. I would highly recommend if cost is not an issue. I use mine every day.",4,16/05/2024,United Kingdom
R2919IEF11FN85,"So I took the plunge on PRIME day as didn't justify its usual price, but very, very happy with it once it arrived. Love you can use an app to check on it too!",5,01/01/2025,United Kingdom
R299WNOWYA6KVD,This thing is heavy I brought it for longer flights incase the power sockets aren't working but after 10 long hall flights I've only taken it on 4 due to the weight.It also has an odd behaviour when using with Lenovo X1 where the laptop won't charge but will take it's power at a varying rate. This is probably a good thing unless the X1 is dead then the brick is pointless.  Just to note the laptop takes full power and charges from a Ugreen 100w wall charger.Shame it doesn't come with a better case it's easy to scratch and probably drop even with the grip groves on the side.,4,19/04/2024,United Kingdom
R2SA0O6LSI212C,"I bought this latest high-capacity power-bank by Anker, as I trust Anker products; having bought lots of their cables, charge plugs and a smaller capacity version of this range of power-bank (a silver-version) - never experiencing a problem with any of them.This super-sized and very fast charging capacity power-bank is the best experienced yet. Definitely at current Amazon.co.uk price, it’s great value.I highly recommend it.",5,11/11/2024,United Kingdom
RVQ4OSRUL5D2I,"Good weight , quality ,I recommend",4,10/10/2024,United Kingdom
R33X8WB8N5ROMA,"Yes, this is a really expensive power bank, but if you need to monitor remotely and in detail, devices being charged then it is worth it.  The connection to the Anker APP separates this from the competition.At first this did not work very well, but after setting the device to Bluetooth Auto Broadcast in the APP settings, I can now see the charging rate and state of all devices attached from anywhere in my home.  If this is useful to you then the high price is worth it.  Adding the charging base (also expensive) charges at a very fast 100W and that can also be monitored in the APP.",4,07/03/2024,United Kingdom

R39W3VEL7T6TH6,Purchased this due to large capacity and brought along with charging dock. Charges really fast and recommend however upon first charge it advised 3 charge cycles?,3,29/10/2024,United Kingdom
R3J1EGTWT5QV1X,I think these are good power banks. But for the price and the level of power it has I would have expected it to do much more than 4 full battery charges on my iPhone before it runs out of juice! The mini screen is nice and the Bluetooth is a nice feature but those aren’t necessarily the things you need in a power bank! It’s supposed to be a reserve power source for when you don’t have access to electricity/socket.,4,06/04/2024,United Kingdom
R2GAZGRH7BYD9M,"Compared this against a couple of other pawer banks of same spec and it didn't live up to its claims, only 2h 35m with a constant 30W dry, where as others managed over 3 hours. Bluetooth is a bit hit and miss.Always been a fan of Anker but think this is a bit to expensive what what it delivers",3,26/09/2024,United Kingdom
R1Y1BO7ZMVHYPB,"I've always been a fan of Anker products, and the Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank is no exception. Right out of the box, the build quality is impressive. It feels sturdy, well-made, and ready to stand up to the daily grind.Now, the standout feature, in my opinion, is the Bluetooth functionality. Initially, I was a bit skeptical, thinking it might be just another gimmick to stand out in a crowded market. But oh, how I was wrong. It’s not only functional but incredibly useful. Being able to simply open the app and instantly check the battery's charge level or its output/input without touching or turning on the power bank is a game-changer. Honestly, major brands like Apple should take a page from Anker's book and consider integrating this feature into products like AirPods.Speaking of the app, the graphics are top-notch. Everything is clear, concise, and user-friendly. Pairing and setup? A breeze. Within minutes, I was up and running, getting all the insights I needed about the power bank's performance.However, it wasn't all roses. Although the power bank promises high input rates by utilizing two ports simultaneously, my tests didn't quite match up to those claims. I used several 100W+ chargers but only managed to achieve a maximum input power rate of about 165W. While this is still impressive, it's worth noting for those looking to push the power bank to its limits.In conclusion, the Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank offers stellar build quality, innovative features, and mostly lives up to its performance promises. While there's room for improvement in power input, the overall experience more than compensates for it. Highly recommended for those seeking a reliable and high-tech charging solution.",5,18/09/2023,United Kingdom
R3O9BR551E0AJP,Great capacity and output. Allows me to charge where I like. Can’t really fault the product just wish my iPhone etc could make a bit more of what is a bit of a beast of a power bank.Popped in a rucksack this should easily have you covered for a long weekend if you leave fully charged.,5,05/10/2024,United Kingdom

R2SNZSDAUD541O,"This powerbank is heavy and well made with a large capacity and very fast charging for laptops, phones or portable games consoles like the steamdeckWhere it falls short on expectation is the accuracy of the ‘Time remaining’ when powering devices that consume under 1w of electricity.

R2UYNI427IZ158,This would be easily be 5 stars but unfortunately had 2 of them coming faulty to me....The first was only charging my phone a couple of times before emptying which isn't normal.They accepted to send me a new one and the new i received was even worst wasn't charging at all with a high pitch sound coming from it. I had several Anker products so far and its the first time i had an issue so was probably my luck😂.I've returned the product for a refund but will definitely order again in the future as its probably the best powerbank on the market at the moment...,3,27/05/2024,United Kingdom
RJWJIY7KJL0V5,This power bank is amazing. It charges my phone quickly and I like the display showing the charging rate and how much power is left on the device.

R3UL9OM67VNZ2P,"Drains too fast and couldn’t get more than 24 watts 12x2 charge input via both USB C as inputs - regardless of what power bricks I tried to charge it with. It finally charged to 100% and charged my mini 3 pro battery at 36w by the time it has finished it was down to 60% charge left. Not good it’s being returned today at my own expense because Amazon won’t allow me to return it via QR code at the post office and I don’t have a printer.To add - this gold version is over priced by £30 the black version (exact same model) is £149.99 instead of 179.99. Complete joke.Another recent matter regarding Anker - I have an issue with my 12 month old Anker 256w power station it has stopped working via USB C and the port is chipped and gets hot now with high cooling fan won’t shut off, Guess what? Anger asked me to send it back In the original packaging (which was threw away within 1 month of purchase) they wanted me to send it back in a fire hazard state despite telling them it doesn’t work and is getting hot just sitting around . I sent the all pictures of the damage and proof along with purchase and they don’t want to know. This company used to be decent back I 2013-2016 now their customer service is rubbish and quality of products have gone down hill. Will not be buying another Anker product ever again.

My main requirement was for something that could charge my phone and camera but, as an added bonus, the outputs on this are enough to power my laptop too.

R128WU2EIVLH6N,"I purchased the 140w 27,650mah PowerBank after paying for the smaller model and with the compatible docking station these are ideal for backups in case of Poweroutages to keep phones, tablets, LED USB lights but it's main purpose is to provide the ability to recharge Drones, Controllers and mobile 4g routers and it's overall been a great device.I don't really have anything negative to say about it really, I just wish they're was a way to update its firmware via the app as you get annoying warning prompts during charging that appear to slow the process down but I can't prove that it's just a feeling. That said, it doesn't prevent me charging so don't hold back on that one minor criticism as the device in general is amazing.",5,09/02/2024,United Kingdom

R150YQNPD8820Z,"This sits up there with the controllers you get with a PS5 or an Xbox and feels weighty in the hand and has a decent tactile feel on its buttons. It is not as good as the dual sense (PS5) , but neither is the Xbox controller. The buttons (A,B,X,Y) are decent and have good push back, the triggers are firm and have a good resistance, the middle buttons (Select etc) are not quite as nicer feel in the hand but i do like the way the middle (Connect or LUNA button) is fully integrated into the controller and does not stand out, im not really a fan of this on the new Xbox Series controller and like the older iteration in the Xbox One. I also like the way the joysticks feel, they are not too loose and have a good rubber, at least currently. There is a textured plastic on the grips which is nice but not quite as good as the new Xbox Series controller.If you already have a controller on the other two platforms it may not be worth getting this but where the LUNA controller comes into its own is the connectivity - it truly feels seamless (From my MacBook to my iPad and then to my FireStick. It comes up with a pop up saying its playing via cloud and just works - almost reminiscent of apple products. It doesn’t replace other controllers but may sit in your portfolio if you are serious about gaming or experiencing what the developers want you to on the platform. As a note the bluetooth works well with the other controllers but you have top connect each time if you move where you are playing, a minor annoyance which may be worth noting.From me the latency is quite important and this feel extremely responsive, i have tried this with an average or 145mb/s internet and 20-40mb/s and they both work well. There was a few pop ups about the internet on the slower and not as constant internet but it didn’t stop me playing.For me this has found a place in my bag, as i travel often, as it works well and i have faith in the service - not to mention that there is quite a large launch library and 4 free games per month, what streaming service gives you that for simply being a member?I recommend this controller but do not expect it to be better than your premium console controller. If you want to get into cloud gaming this is a very good start (Better than the stadia controller, but lets not get into that catastrophe or a platform), if you care about ease, connectivity and simply working this works well!",5,13/04/2023,United Kingdom
R1LAM4Q4B1SGF,"If you have prime, you get 5 free games a month on Amazon Luna Subscription or pay 9.99 and get a larger selection plus also stream a majority of Ubisoft games that you may own. By far the best quality and reliability streaming service of which there are not many around.The controller itself is a good size and fairly comfortable with excellent grips, doesnt slide in the hands like xbox or ps. It is easy to put into bluetooth pairing mode and works well but the trick up its sleeve is the awesome inbuilt wifi receiver, its game changing! The amazon luna service is available as an app or web page on pretty much any device, if it can stream the web page the controller automatically connects to it once turned on its brilliant. On your PC, on your tablet, on your TV, on your Tesla.Tesla made it awkward to connect a controller to its newer cars until bluetooth support becomes available, but stream Amazon Luna on the web browser in the car and fire up the controller and away you go!Cons: Only few gripes are buttons are a bit firm to press, at the moment there is no replacement battery charger pack (just use a AA battery plug in charger) and the price. Its not cheap but to be fair its like two controllers in one, you may never need anything else and the technology is unique and just works out the box and you can wait for an Amazon sale. One controller I ordered did not work correctly but another positive of this Amazon controller is the usual Amazon service applies meaning replacement sent out asap 👌",5,09/07/2023,United Kingdom
R1CADSGEQVVDNR,"Firstly, the controller itself works perfectly with regular PC games, it's easy to connect to your PC and it works well.Ergonomically, the controller is comfortble to grip, and it feels like a premium X-Box controller (better quality than X-Box controllers)I think it is overpriced however. £60 is retal price for a proper PS5 Dualsense controller.The ""LUNA"" gaming service is pretty rubbish too, there aren't many games worth playing. Lego Fortnite is probably the only game on LUNA anyone has ever heard of.The games are very laggy, the resolution quality is poor, the audio quality is poor, and the controller continually disconnects from the service.Overall this is a great controller to use for regular PC gaming, but I don't recommend the Amazon ""LUNA"" cloud gaming service, purely because of the lack of ""good"" games and the constant connection issues.",4,15/01/2024,United Kingdom
R2IQWNGY25YYYQ,"I had been using a cheap wireless xbox style controller for a few years and it started to break on me, and since I thought I'd try to use Amazon Luna for my fire stick and on my PC too I went and bought the luna controller, its a good controller, feels nice and sturdy, cloud direct works well and connects via USB-C for wired / hard connections. Well worth the pricetag in my opinion",5,02/08/2024,United Kingdom
R2AAE0QKVDLZAS,Fantastic!! Just plugged it in to PC and within 5 seconds both PCs simply downloaded a Amazon luna controller straight from tbe windows 10 database and I was gaming on it all but instantly!!Worked great on my TV to I needed only to load up Dragons dogma and the controller almost instantly connected to cloud direct ( I had been playing game on my phone but there was around 0.25s of latency !! ) and the latency was gone!!A 10/10 purchase on both that I bought in last week incredibly easy to use ( on windows 10 anyway ).,5,17/02/2025,United Kingdom

However my internal WIFI is 5GHZ and not the newer standard. whilst playing games the quality is poor at best.The Luna application constantly complains about Network speeds. I believe this is because it requires WIFI 6e or above. You can turn the Network notifications off, however the quality of play is poor.The actual controllers are really well made and feel premium. I plan on upgrading my my home WIFI network and will report back to see if the experience has improved.",3,23/01/2024,United Kingdom

R18YHV3H0MSZR6,"Firstly this is a Luna controller so it’s primarily used to play games on Luna over WiFi, however you can also connect to a PC to use as a wired controller, and if you install a Windows driver on your PC you can also use it over Bluetooth so it’s very versatile.This isn’t a review for the Luna platform so I won’t spend too much time on this, but with Prime you get some free games to play each month which is really good value (and you don’t necessarily need to have the controller to do so, but worth picking up if you do play regularly, especially if the controller is on sale).The controller itself feels solid, well built and the buttons feel clicky in all the right places. It feels comfortable in the hand, not too dissimilar to an Xbox controller. In fact if you’re used to using an Xbox controller then the button placement (A B X Y) and thumbsticks placement (asymmetrical) will feel very familiar as it’s the same with the Luna controller.Once you’ve done the original setup, connecting to Luna is a breeze and really easy to switch from screen to screen - you can stop playing on phone, pick it up on PC, then switch to TV (with a fire stick) which is such an amazing experience, and something only Google Stadia (RIP) could do otherwise.TLDR: pick up this controller, you won’t regret it.",5,26/12/2023,United Kingdom
R32PZ2OEU5ZPNS,"The controller is 'fine' in terms of build quality, not great but not bad. Other reviews saying this is on par with the latest Xbox pads are wide of the mark and people comparing with the Dualsense have no idea what they are talking about; the controller is nothing like the standard you get with any of the latest gen consoles. The buttons are reasonably tactile and the finish on the surface is just ok.There is no built in lithium battery and there is no option to purchase one, like a play and charge kit for example. You are forced into using AA batteries (which are provided and do seem to last a long time).The controller cannot be used over Bluetooth with Apple devices, tried an Apple TV and an iPad pro, can't comment on Android as I haven't tried. Why you would connect it via Bluetooth to any other device I can not understand, so Bluetooth connectivity is NOT a selling feature. I see no reason to connect it to my PC as I have an Xbox dongle with various controllers for that sole purpose. If I were using a competing cloud platform for example Geforce Now, then any controller would do the trick.The only real use case/USP for this device is with the actual Luna platform. The main selling feature for me, being reduced latency due to a WiFi connection.The logging in and setting up process was seamless and the connection is very stable but the difference in latency is not massive, contrary to what various YouTube videos led me to believe. It feels a little more responsive than Bluetooth controllers but certainly nothing to write home about (I am on 900mb full fibre).The biggest issue is the limited places I can use this controller. If Luna was an amazing service and I used it all the time then I could say confidently this is the best way to access it... But unfortunately that isn't the case.The platform is very poor with clunky integrations with some second-rate PC store fronts (GOG and Ubisoft). Constantly being bombarded with adverts to 'upgrade' to some extra tier with extra benefits. Most of the Ubisoft games I own don't even show up as playable which seems odd to say the least but that's kind of how Ubisoft is these days (unreliable and kind of rubbish). Monthly Prime Games are literally like 20 year old PC titles that I've either already played or have no interest in. The only other game worthy of playing as of right now is Fortnite but a competitive shooter over the cloud against a load of twitchy-fingered 12-year olds playing at 120 fps on PC/PS5? No thanks.I haven't actually picked the controller up in a few weeks because there aren't any games I want to play on this service and if I want to play Fortnite, I want to play it properly (and natively).Perhaps if Epic went all in with Amazon and allowed you to access your Epic library through Luna, this may become a worthwhile purchase.For now though, it's so heavily reliant on the quality of the Luna offering, and this falls well short, the controller feels like a bit of a waste of money.",2,31/12/2024,United Kingdom
R3Q41TFZ1BQ833,Well built only disappointment is that it uses  batteries and isn't rechargeable.,5,12/03/2025,United Kingdom

R2CNM83HUEUB70,"The product is good. Works well, feels robust and connects well. My main issue is it runs off AA batteries which is ridiculous for something costing £60, albeit I got mine in the black Friday sale for £35. You can plug it in to the mains via a USB cable to save battery power, but wired controllers at this price is shocking! Come on Amazon!",4,04/12/2024,United Kingdom
R1YIKR4IQD4OCU,"The controller is great, have had no issues playing games with it & I prefer it a lot more than the steam controller. I also like the multiple ways you can connect it, over wifi, I use it this way usually as all you have to do it turn the controller on & it's picked up if you have luna open. Nomatter which device I open luna on all I need to do is turn the controller on & it connects. Bluetooth requires you to have bluetooth enabled on whatever device you're using & lastly you can just plug the controller in with the usb cable. The cable that comes with it is for that purpose, it's not a charging cable, it does power the controller though so you can still game if your batteries are flat.You need two AA batteries, if you use rechargeables you cannot charge them while they are in the controller. That's the only downside & why I knocked 1 star off.",4,14/05/2024,United Kingdom
R1FKN4NF0G8GXE,The controller is very well made easy to set up on Luna app the games play smoothly death stranding is the best graphics I have seen paying subscription is well worth the money only need a fire stick or fire tv no more having to fork out 400 to 500 for a games machine this is the way forward in cloud gaming would highly recommend,5,25/12/2024,United Kingdom
R1F3GJNOK1167B,"The controller feels like a smaller version of the Xbox Series controller, but build quality isn't as good.I downloaded the Luna app and it wouldn't connect to to the WiFi as wpa3 isn't supported yet, it asked me to switch on wpa2/wpa3 so it could work - but that already on.Asked customer services about it and they said it isn't compatible with all android devices (mine being a pixel pro 8) but that isn't alluded to anywhere in the advertisement for this controller.Works fine as a Bluetooth/pc controller though.Also it doesn't come with a wire for connecting to pc, which is a shame.So lost two stars because either the Amazon helper had no idea how to fix the issue so just went with 'its not compatible ' or Amazon lied when it said it's compatible with Android devices as clearly... Not all of them.",3,27/08/2024,United Kingdom

A good range of games too with some free and also a handful with amazon prime membership.The controller works with Xbox Cloud gaming too.Excellent value for money, the build quality of the controller is excellent too.Only downside is you can't recharge the batteries so needed to purchase some rechargeable one.",5,07/12/2024,United Kingdom
R1ZK9TCQOVHLDN,"Feels nice, worked well.",5,22/01/2025,United Kingdom
R2F1NIVSJVBLLM,"Pros:Conceptually, this controller is a great idea. To be able to connect to a multitude of devices that accepts the Luna app is pretty novel.The controller has the usual format of buttons resembling an Xbox, its built pretty well and connects ok to everything from a Ipad, Kindle Fire to a Fire Stick on the TV. It's pretty portable so would be a good makeshift games console for those on the move a lot.Cons:The device that you play this on heavily dictates the enjoyment and playability, the difference between using a latest Ipad to a Fire Stick can be vast, so it's worth bearing that in mind.Also, the subscription to pay more than the 5 games that comes with a Prime subscription can be quite steep. My children were pretty smitten with Fortnite that was really good. but otherwise it could be quite a costly subscription.",4,07/11/2023,United Kingdom
R58UG45668C61,"Fab, but you really do need a subscription to ubisoft to make it worth the money as the free games with the amazon prime account are a bit naff also a very good WiFi connection is really important as it can be a bit jerky if the bandwidth is slow, I also recommend you buy rechargeable batteries and a charger as its no fun when you batteries die during a game. I love it bit not so sure its worth the price but it's ideal for me for when I'm working away from home.",4,09/04/2024,United Kingdom
RTD6YT9KDXCOQ,"Good quality controller. Once set up using WiFi it will automatically connect to whichever device you are playing Luna games on.

RIG3ZADYE5G1U,"It's difficult to review the luna controller without reviewing the Luna streaming service.The controller is well built, the buttons though very 'clicky' compared to say it's most obvious relation the Xbox controller and I doubt there is very much if any analogue feature to them such as a soft press.However it works well, the analogue sticks are good and responsive and there are plenty of set up options.  It has to be said that it takes 2 AA batteries and as yet there are no available charging packs with dock available and the USB C connection doesn't charge rechargables if fitted.  Controller though does work with PC directly coupled by the USB C cable but also has wireless and bluetooth connectivity.When using as a bluetooth controller (I tried with gamepass) it is Ok and works well but I would still choose a PS or XBOX controller.When it comes to using it with the Luna service you see the benefit of the wireless control.  You can pair the bluetooth to any device but have to repair when moving, with the wireless - you can use any device be it tablet with Luna App or PC with browser or even the Fire Stick and as long as they are on the same network the device will be synced to your luna controller which takes the effort out of pairing and makes it truly multiplatform.  On the Luna app with Fortnite it had little to no lag and was great to use, some other games did take a bit of tinkering to play well as they are PC versions but overall a really good experience.  What lets it all down is the games available on Luna, there simply are not enough of interest to make the subscription worthwhile and if you want Ubisoft on top thats another £12 a month.So overall a decent controller which works really well with Luna streaming service.  Luna service is more reliable and plays better for me than the Gamepass online bus simply doesn't have the support in games to make it worthwhile yet.",2,03/07/2023,United Kingdom
R14EALY2HQ2936,Heavy but comfortable.My main problem is getting this controller to work with Luna. With the controller Bluetooth paired to the operating system works no problems. But the Luna app does not always pick it up and I have to either reboot which sometimes works or I have to delete the Bluetooth Pairing.The help from Luna is insulting and points to how to setup a Bluetooth pairing. I have this issue on Macbook pro and my Samsung TV.I have noticed round the thumb controllers they have started to ware and are not as responsive from when it was new. I don't have any black spots yet.,3,11/06/2024,United Kingdom
R1CBAR33X6N06U,"The controller, for someone who has always been using Xbox controllers, feels very nice. It has a classic design, and responds nicely... BUT... it is now only a few weeks old and it drifts on the two joysticks already, and there is no calibration options in the phone app that I can find. The right joystick drifts up at high speed, not a slow constant drift, and the left joystick does the same, but to the left. This is NOT how it is supposed to be, and I do hope a company like Amazon will allow for, at least a software recalibration to be entered into the accompanying software.",4,08/12/2023,United Kingdom
R6FZO6PYCQYIW,"Nice controller and the Luna game streaming works well for me as a casual gamer who doesn't care too much as long as the gamers play OK.Luna delivers 1920px to my tablet, Chromebook or non-gaming laptop smoothly - I don't have especially fast WIFI but that's probably what would let things down if anything. I don't want to push limits of games, just play smoothly and it does that fine for me.The controller is one of the common button layouts and feels solid. I use AA rechargeables and they seem to take a few weeks of casual (not every day) gaming to deplete. Connectivity is fine, Bluetooth for non Luna and WIFI for Luna games, sometimes need to reboot like all wireless devices to get it to connect.I don't want to mess around ""tweaking"" settings and just want to dip into games every day or so on whatever device is to hand and it does this really well for me, in the UK with the inexpensive broadband or 4/5G sim cards.",5,07/01/2024,United Kingdom
R282U7I7HJS0A7,It’s a great controller it makes playing games from Luna much better my only complaint is that it’s very expensive I get that it’s wireless and it’s very easy to connect but a deal on them during prime days would make them infinitely more desirable,4,21/05/2024,United Kingdom
R8XWYATGY6H5C,"It feels like a good controller, works fine and connected to my firestick with ease.My main problem, which has lost it 2 stars, is that none of the games on Luna actually work on my Fire HD. It's an Amazon device, they all work with the firestick, so I cannot figure why the games won't work with it.It appears that the controller will work on the Fire HD, so it may be harsh to dock stars, but I feel I have to.I shall also change my review of my Fire HD.If Amazon do a software update I will be happy to give 5 stars",3,02/06/2024,United Kingdom

Its very responsive when playing games.The controller itself fits nicely in the hand with all the buttons easy to reach.  The build quality is Solid.  The benefit of this controller is that you can connect via amazon's WIFI or Bluetooth depending on what you play it on.I took it with me on holiday and for some reason could not connect via the WIFI provided so I connected via Bluetooth and its work just as well.  And that was on the Amazon Fire tablet 11 max.  Worked beautifully.  Unfortunately  the WIFI wasn't that good when playing games, so I had to abandon my gaming.But overall if you want a Amazon Cloud gaming experience at its full, then get this controller.",5,21/10/2023,United Kingdom
R2J6IEVISKHLDW,"Controller is superb. Good fit in your hand, solid, and quality feel. Easily compared with any official console controller. Setup is a breeze. Just hold in the home button for three seconds and it connects itself to your Echo or Fire TV. There are five free games a month of you have Prime that you can play on the Amazon Luna app. Much more available if you want to subscribe (from £8.99 a month). These are typically games you may have seen in your Xbox or PlayStation over the last year or two. If you have one of those consoles, this might not be for you, as you may have played most of them already. If you don't have one of those consoles then this is a super purchase. The streaming was great on out Fire TV (using the 4k max stick). I've been really impressed with it and we tried it on our Fire tablet too. Fantastic controller though that you can use in your PC too if you prefer.",5,24/08/2023,United Kingdom

RBTXH1RS52DTV,"Controller feels good quality and is responsive when playing. The Luna service itself has a good offering of games although I feel that they need to work on adding more titles to the Luna+ subscription to keep subscribers.There’s monthly games with Prime that don’t require the Luna+ subscription though those alone may not be enough to make people shell out for the controller (and are games included in the Luna+ sub already). There’s a few good well known titles on the subscription such as Control, Alien Isolation and some older Capcom games - though the service did just lose Resident Evil 2 and 3. There’s also a good selection of games from lesser known studios, such as Tormented Souls, Dusk and a number of others.",5,09/06/2023,United Kingdom
R1N8K7SR9H9376,Good build quality and connectivity. However like all Amazon products it ties you down to a subscription to play the games on the Luna app. Signed up to the 7 day free trial but the app and the account would not communicate. Made several calls to Customer Services with each offering a solution that simply didn’t work. Turns out that it has to be registered and used by the account holder that the unit was purchased from.

R22R8AF6GDGYA4,"The controller can connect over WFi however you are then limited to using it to control the Luna app ONLY. If you stick with Bluetooth connection you can use the controller to control the Fire TV Stick/ Cube and the Luna app, so why use the Wi Fi connection for the marginal at best improvement to latency. Personally, whilst the Wi-Fi Direct connection is a great idea, it’s hobbled (again), I’d prefer use Bluetooth mode for convenience.My other frustration is with Bluetooth controller implementation on Amazon TV products. if you want to use other game streaming services, think again! Amazon use their own button layout (non XInput) so if you want to use GeForce Now, XBox Game Pass, Boosteroid etc, for some inexplicable reason the menu (hamburger) button, whilst looks the same on every controller known to man, operates differently on Fire products. Why? It’s just completely unnecessary.. get a Nvidia Shield instead for maximum compatibility.After saying all of this the controller does actually feel great in the hand and if you are looking for a quality Bluetooth controller this competes with the others around this price point.",2,24/03/2023,United Kingdom

RLWIKDWZ6GO7U,"The Renogy 2000W Inverter has been an absolute game changer for my off-grid setup! From the moment I unboxed it, I could tell this was a high-quality product. The sleek design, sturdy build, and clear instructions made installation a breeze.Performance-wise, this inverter is a powerhouse. It effortlessly converts DC power to AC, providing a stable and reliable power source for all my needs. Whether it's running my refrigerator, power tools, or charging my devices, the Renogy 2000W handles everything with ease. The pure sine wave output is perfect for sensitive electronics, and I've noticed no interference or noise whatsoever.One of the standout features is its efficiency. It operates so quietly and smoothly that I sometimes forget it’s even running. The advanced safety features give me peace of mind, knowing that my equipment is protected against overloads and overheating.Customer service from Renogy has been top-notch as well. They were incredibly responsive to my queries and provided excellent support throughout the setup process.If you're looking for a reliable, efficient, and high-performance inverter, look no further than the Renogy 2000W. It has exceeded all my expectations and has become an indispensable part of my energy setup. I couldn't be happier with my purchase!Highly recommend!",5,01/08/2024,United Kingdom
R1AFMVZD8RWLYJ,"Fantastic product. Looks great, works as stated, powerful, efficient, easy to install. I’ve fitted 100amp fuses on the positive and negative 50mm from the battery terminal and ground connection for extra safety. Also a 100amp isolator switch is highly recommended. Just based on my limited knowledge and looking at reputable installations. Treat the installation as you would an electrical install in your home.",5,03/01/2025,United Kingdom
R13F1WEEY0BV5M,"EditHaving had issues with the Renogy inverter (see below) I now have it functioning correctly.For the initial installation I used the cables supplied with the unit.Renogy contacted me due to my poor review. I was told my system was not up to the power requirements, my battery was insufficient or my induction stove was pulling a surge current tripping the unit out.Following advice from a 3rd party I replaced the cables supplied with a 50mm2 alternative on both +ve and -ve terminals. It now operates my induction hob at 1900watts without issue.So, as long as you use higher quality cable than those supplied it seems a good inverter. I wish the same could be said for Renogy’s customer service.I have increased the score initially given to reflect my updated experience with this unit.Original review:-“Good looking sturdy unit which was straightforward to install.Performance with my portable induction hob was less than satisfactory.I tried it with a ring at full power (1900watts) and it tripped out after a few seconds.I reduced the power level in stages until it would continue to run. That was at 1450watts.Pretty disappointing for a unit rated at 2000watts continuous.Cannot recommend to others. If I hadn’t disposed of the packaging it would be going back.Shame really as the Renogy DC-DC charger with MPPT I bought to run alongside the inverter is really good.”",4,13/08/2021,United Kingdom
R3EEQXI3NI7DNQ,"I purchased this inverter to go with my small solar setup.  Having recently invested in a LIFEPO4 battery i needed something to power our Projector.  There are a ton of inverter out there, one thing i knew i wanted was a pure sine wave inverter from a reputable brand.  My projector is worth £3500 and i did not want to blow it up with a cheap inverter!Having read a ton of reviews and watched lots of social media videos i decided this Renogy 1000w fitted my requirements.The device itself is huge!  Much bigger than i expected.  It feels substantial - and the build quality is excellent.  Wiring up the inverter to the battery was a 2 minute job using the included cables.  You also get a wired remote with the inverter, but i decided not to use this.  The inverter has one 3 pin UK plug socket on the front.  I connected up my projector and powered it on - it worked great!What i really love about this inverter is that it is totally silent!  My projector on ECO modes draws around 170w, and clearly the inverter is comfortable with this load without ramping up the internal fan.  We have a smaller 500w inverter which we use to power other small device, but this thing is noisy!!! So it was great that the Renogy was silent.  We use the inverter for around 4-5hrs a night, and yes it is reasonably warm after this time, but nothing that would concern me.  The device is fully fused and has good safety features.  I had zero concerns using this device.  I have not pushed it anywhere near it's limits, and too be honest do not intend too as i purchased this solely for my projector.Overall i am super impressed with this inverter and would not hesitate to recommend it to others!",5,07/02/2023,United Kingdom
RCP297YL44LD6,"Works great, laughs at any load, the remote control has a simple pinout so you can tap into it to remotely turn on or off if you want (and I have extended my remote cable with a plain male-female Cat6 cable extender, about 10m, but watch that it's wired straight pin-to-pin).Silent below about 100W draw, then ramps up fans over that depending on the load.  Seems pretty bulletproof.Only unfortunate thing is that you can't silence the low battery alarm, and it can be quite piercing, but it's an alarm for a reason.  Would be nice if either a) that audible alarm has extended into the remote unit so you could hear it where you need to, but all you get is a tiny LED, or b) you could silence the alarm so that the inverter isn't beeping all night because the battery bank got drained overnight.Be aware that, like a lot of inverters, you can still get a nasty shock from the battery *INPUT* lugs even after it's been switched off.  Don't just assume that because it's an input it won't come back out and get you from the internal capacitors.",5,14/09/2023,United Kingdom
R2XVUSL2BTZU2F,Received this yesterday and was surprised at the cables . This is a 2000W inverter with a 4000W peak yet the cables are 4AWG . they are also quite short . This also needs a 250 amp fuse . So unless you already have your own cables and fuse and holder be prepared to spend another £50 or so to make this a safe product to use . After contacting Renogy  their response was they try to keep costs down to make it affordable . Personally I would like to pay a bit more and have a product that is up to the job and is safe . I have asked if I can buy better cables from them but they don’t sell them .To be fair it was packaged well and seems to be well built . But I’m not taking a chance and will be returning and getting one that’s safe and up to the job .,1,13/06/2024,United Kingdom

R34T9UL1TID0FS,"Well, I wish I would have purchased this in the first place, I originally had another well known 3kw inverter but it kept bleeping and shutting down when connected to a 1200w coffee machine,  I sent it back and ordered a replacement only for that to do the same..so I opted for this renogy inverter and have to say I am pleasantly surprised... This by the way is for in my motorhome,  so far its run a modern nespresso machine, 2  colour TV... just small ones, compressor fridge, and I've even had the water boiler on with it, there is 2 temp settings on the water heater, 40 and 60, it did the 40 without breaking a sweat, but the 60 really hammered my lithium batteries x2 100a Also Renogy... they started off on 100% and by the time the water had finished they were down to 46%...I am new to lithium and have only just installed them but this inverter is without a shadow of doubt the Boss.. not cut out or bleeped or gone into overload protection or anything..very pleased with it and highly recommend it.I only opted to buy it via amazon because of their excellent customer service returns policy  I could have got it £30 cheaper from the supplier off their website but then you have the hassle of returning it if anything is wrong, whereas amazon arrange a collection from your door next day..Inverter 10/10  and 5*Update: I have had this now while on tour around Europe with all the standard fittings that came with the inverter itself and can say with honesty i have not had a single issue with it - i have an induction hob connected on 2000w an Air Conditioner running 800w and also a Nespresso coffee machine all running together, the cables never felt warm or even tepid, and what is surprising to me to date is i have not once ever heard the fans come on - the inverter i purchased before this Renogy system - which was also a 3000w - The fan used to come on as soon as you turned something on, then within 30 seconds would beep and shut down - so on my personnel experience i still stand by the 5 stars i gave it - and in fact i have purchased another but via Renogy web site, at the time it was on offer at nearly £40 less than Amazon plus i got 5% off nearly £15 for a voucher - i personally cannot fault it !",5,10/08/2021,United Kingdom

R3MDE75PJP2AI2,"This is only based on first tests of the inverter. But there is definitely room for improvement. The socket seems mechanically not up to standards. Inserting plugs is very fiddly. I tried various plugs and it takes on all of them quite some bit of wriggling to get the ground pin past the child safety.The quiescent current on the DC side is shown as 0.6A. This is quite a house number. Multiplied by the the 13V from the battery that is 7.8W for doing nothing usable. You better do not forget to switch the inverter off.Other than those initial niggles the inverter has been behaving as one would expect. I still gave a full rating as high quiescent currents are unfortunately pretty common on such inverters, despite there being existing circuitry for micro inverters which can do a lot better. Less than 1W is perfectly doable. At those 7.8W you would have drained a fully charged 200Ah battery in just over 12 days on standby.But I will keep my eye on developments and revise my review once the inverter will get used more. I do not plan to plug and unplug frequently, hence I just accept it as it is for now.",5,15/02/2022,United Kingdom

Fan doesn't come on until you really push them. Current draw on the 1000w is low, 3000w is a little too much. But you don't leave these on all day anyway so...One small niggle is that the unit beeps when power is disconnected. Makes sense as an alert but I'd love a way to have it configurable as I often have the 1000w inverter lose power when a thermostat level is reached. It'd be nice to have it be silent.

R2U595YYY4IFJM,"All the inverters are fully protected, gives you the power it says it gives you and should last a long time as its a seriously high quality machine for the money. Don't buy a dodgy unknown rip off, it will last 6 months a pop. The 1000w will power most  domestic 240v products if using one item at a time if it draws a fair bit. However don't make the mistake i made as i wanted to power a 700w microwave. Be careful as 700w is the cooking power not the consumption power. The microwave will consume 1200w approx so if you intend to briefly power a microwave now and again you will need to upgrade to the 2000w machine. Love the mains power lead too. This means if you plug into hook up it will act as an extension lead and you don't have to swap plug sockets. Customer service was good too when i did upgrade. All ill buy from now on is renogy.

This unit really feels well made and up for the task, and doesnt suffer from the annoyances you get with the cheaper non-branded units.The battery terminals are spot on and feel really secure, you dont have to deal with irritating beebs on high surge loads, and the added automatic transfer swith is amazing and really needs to be a more common option on the smaller units (1-2kw inverters).It happily runs a medium/large fridge freezer, microwave and a coffee machine (not at the same time) with no issues, and has even ran my house completely off grid for several hours. It's pretty quiet too!An added bonus i found is that the included remote uses a standard ethernet network terminal. It comes with a generous amount of wire, but is also able to utilize a female to female ethernet coupler, allowing you to increase the legnth significantly, really usefull!I may have finnaly found a brand i can trust when it comes to this type of equipment.Thank you Renogy, i'll be checking out your solar panels next!",5,27/02/2020,United Kingdom

But powers hedge trimmers and other power tools easily enough. High volume alarms beeps once it cuts out.Hopefully it lasts well into next year and beyond.",5,29/08/2022,United Kingdom
RI3OSCI5OEN9J,"Good quality as you expect from Renogy, bought to replace a Half Wave Inverter that had stopped running my Induction Hob, I had since realised that it needed to be a Pure Sine wave type to run an Induction Load, my bad, but neither did the instructions say otherwise on the Edecoa model, so I installed the Renogy unit instead and it works a treat.",5,18/08/2023,United Kingdom

R7FB6YM1J3U2G,"This inverter is only suitable for emergency use because there is no way to protect yourself from shock by using an RCD because the earth and neutral can't be bonded, so even if you fit an RCD after the inverter, it will never trip. Look for an inverter with a built-in RCD or the live and neutral bonded, because your life is worth more than a cheap inverter. In one of the photos it shows an orange LED with the letters GF for Ground Fault on it, mine came with no such indicator, and if you look at the photo next to it there is no orange LED too, this is false advertising on a critical area of safety. It gets 2 stars because everything works as intended.",2,20/05/2023,United Kingdom

R119Y6CSK5GIG9,If you order this from Uk be careful.The wires are crap they expect you to double them up (not safe in my opinion) so will cost you at least 50 quid for decent 70mm2 wire. It had a mark on it when it arrived I now suspect it was a second. You will only get message chat from renogy (frustrating to say the least) Didn’t even power up an 800 watt George grill. Personally I’d give renogy a wide swerve it just made a loud noise no error lights or shutdown ( dangerous) worst customer service I’ve ever seen and trying to activate warranty was a joke.

I spoke to Renogy support and told them 25mm cable was nowhere near big enough to power this unit and would cause the cables to overheat and  potentially cause a fire.  They replied and said there are 2 red and 2 black and both should be used.I told them that these are still not big enough.  They would only take about 180 amps current in ideal conditions and the cable could still melt if the unit was used on current draw above this.They then replied that a 120mm cable should be used. I asked for them to send that cable, since the listing says it comes with cables,  and to explain why they are supplying dangerously undersized cables and why they follow up with terrible advice. Renogy uk did not reply.For this reason I am leaving one star.  I wonder how many people have installed the inverter with these cables.",1,17/02/2022,United Kingdom

REPPKMTL0EYE5,"I’ve been using the Tapo Wi-Fi Smart Plug for a few weeks now, and I’m really impressed with how easy it is to integrate into my home. The setup was quick and simple, and I was able to get everything connected to the Tapo app in no time. The app itself is user-friendly, allowing me to manage devices remotely, set up automated schedules, and even use timers to control when devices turn on or off.The device-sharing feature is fantastic for my household, as it allows my family to control the plugs as well. I love the Away Mode, which is ideal for security when we’re out of the house, as it randomly turns devices on and off to give the impression that someone’s home. The voice control feature is a bonus, and it works perfectly with my Amazon Alexa, making it so convenient to control everything with simple voice commands.The 4-pack is great value, especially since I’ve used the plugs to control lights, fans, and other devices. The only downside I’ve noticed is that the plugs are a bit bulky, so they might block adjacent sockets if you're using a power strip. Overall, I’m really happy with these smart plugs and would recommend them for anyone looking to add some automation and convenience to their home.",5,18/02/2025,United Kingdom

R8RWANF3P6YJS,"To use the plugs, one must install the Topo app. It is only when one installs the app that one comes across its privacy policy, which is intrusive and impossible to accept. Following are highlights of the policy:TP-Link will collect information about the devices connected to the plugs (Point 2.3). They may collect IP address, location, mobile device information, user name, email address, shipping address, log-in and password details [!!], communications via phone calls, e-mail, social media, … the list is extensive and alarming (Point 4). Not only will TP-Link be allowed to use such information itself, it is also allowed to transfer such information to third parties (Point 5.2). Furthermore, customer information may be transferred to parties that may acquire TP-Link in the future (Point 5.4).One buys a wifi-enabled plug to connect to one’s devices to power supply remotely. It must be able to manufacture plugs that do just that without requiring an app to set up. More importantly, there is no reason for the plug to collect so much information from its customers. There is even less justification for them to pass our personal information to third parties. Whether or how they may be able to collect such information is secondary. I cannot grant them permission to do so.Therefore I intend to return the product.",1,23/01/2021,United Kingdom

It's random with these, sometimes she does it straight away and sometimes it takes up to 2 minutes, hence 4 stars instead of 5.Just something to be aware of before you purchase these plugs.",4,14/02/2025,United Kingdom

RRKCRF58ZGZQF,I've tried a few types and they can be fiddly and then fail often.  These Tapo smart plugs seem more reliable and are very much more simple to set up in around 90secs per plug.,5,24/02/2025,United Kingdom

R3BEQAUQFFIX5G,"I got the Tapo P100 Alexa smart plug thinking I’d be living in a sci-fi movie, barking commands at Alexa like a tech genius. The reality? Well, it’s been a bit of a journey. First off, I love that it doesn’t need a hub because, let’s be honest, I barely know what a hub is, and the fewer mystery gadgets around, the better. Alexa listens, though like a teenager, she does it on her own terms. I told her to turn off the lamp, and instead, my toaster stopped working. Why? No clue, but it was hilarious.The Tapo app lets me turn things on and off while I’m away from home, which is perfect for randomly turning on the living room lights while I’m at work just to freak out the cat. I also set the plug to turn off my coffee machine in the morning, which sounds genius, except for the time I was still pouring my first cup when everything suddenly shut down like the Matrix collapsed.Now, the downside: there’s no energy monitoring, so while it can help me turn off a forgotten fan, I still don’t know how much that fan is adding to my electric bill. Setup had its moments too — make sure you’re in the same room as the router! It took me a good 10 minutes of confusion before I realized my phone was connected to my neighbor’s Wi-Fi.Sharing control with the family is fun, but do so wisely. I gave my spouse access, and suddenly my lamp was blinking in Morse code at 3 a.m. when I was trying to sleep. Revenge? Probably.All in all, it’s a great little gadget. Just be sure your router, your phone, and maybe a few prayers are nearby during setup. Would I recommend it? Yes. Would I trust it with my coffee machine again? Jury’s still out on that one.",5,05/10/2024,United Kingdom
R28KZ0Q78NKUCB,Purchased a set of four plugs to be used around the house. Very easy set-up through the app and only takes minutes. Also simple to control from phone. Not used any voice activation so not sure if that is possible. But it is sleek and does the job I needed them to do which was to schedule devices. Purchased more since for a family member.,5,08/02/2025,United Kingdom
R2KTA045R9IRMG,"I've been on the hunt for smart plugs that are both reliable and affordable, and the Tapo Smart Plug Wi-Fi Outlet 4-pack has exceeded my expectations in every way.Initially, I bought these smart plugs to solve a very specific problem: the nightly hassle of getting out of bed to turn off my salt lamp. As someone who loves to wind down by journaling or watching something cozy, the last thing I want to do is disrupt my relaxation by getting up. Enter Tapo Smart Plugs – my bedtime routine has never been smoother.I've been using these plugs for a month now, and the setup was a breeze. Simply follow the clear instructions on the app to pair each plug with your Wi-Fi, and you're ready to go. The user-friendly app allows you to control your devices from anywhere, whether you're snuggled up in bed or out running errands. I've tested it extensively, even when I’m far from home, and it works like a charm every time.The ""Away"" mode, which turns your devices on and off at random intervals to make it look like someone’s home, is a handy feature. You can also schedule your devices to turn on and off at specific times, perfect for automating your morning coffee routine or ensuring the lights are off when you leave the house. The timer option is another useful tool, allowing you to set a countdown for your devices.The app also provides insightful data on your usage patterns. The interface is sleek and intuitive, with a shortcut option to turn everything off with one tap. You can add shortcuts within the app or on your iPhone to switch off or on the smart plugs all at the same time, which is effective and adds a cool touch to my bedroom. While the plugs are compatible with Alexa and Google Home, I've been using Siri shortcuts on my iPhone. It's a slightly longer setup process, but worth it for voice control, though it can be a bit temperamental.A quirky yet satisfying detail is the subtle click sound the plugs make when switching on or off – a small touch that adds to the overall smart home experience. The versatility of these smart plugs is impressive; anything you can plug in, you can now control remotely. Plus, they make for a cool little party trick. My friends are always amazed when I control the lights with my phone, thinking I have some sort of magical power!Compared to other smart plugs on the market, the value for money with this 4-pack is unbeatable. Whether you're looking to automate a single lamp or your entire home, these smart plugs are the way to go. I can't recommend them enough!With these smart plugs, the possibilities are truly endless. Say goodbye to outdated manual switches and hello to a smarter, more convenient home. Trust me, you'll wonder how you ever lived without them!",5,22/06/2024,United Kingdom

R2SUHJNOUVS46T,"These plugs are fantastic!  You download the app, create a login using your email address and a password (which doesn't need to have 9million characters and six different categories of characters!!). Then, you plug the item into a socket, hold your phone next to it and it appears on your app.  Give it a name (e.g. Lounge Lamp) and from there, you can set whatever you want.  You can press the 'on' symbol on the app to turn it on and same for off. You can 'schedule' the plug to come on and go off at whatever times you want.  You can set it to be 'on for xx hours'.  There are holiday schedules, daylight schedules and all manner of controls.  And, all those controls are easy.  As long as you have wi-fi, you can switch the device on or off by just one click of a button.  If you've lost your phone, you can press the button on the side of the plug and it'll come on then press it again and it goes off.  It's just so easy!  I'm so pleased that I did some research and ended up with these plugs.  Would absolutely recommend them!",5,26/10/2024,United Kingdom
R21U2YMT7X0VD2,"This is the second set I have purchased.  These arrived earlier than expected, just plug them in and your app says it has found it, walks thru the setup and they are up and running within about a minute. I do have a different brand which I have never been able to set up.  I did have another go with the Meross set and after an hour gave up.  This time they go in the bin and no back in the drawer.  Buy TAPO they are so good and you can set up a schedule, great for Christmas Tree lights and even better to turn lights on and off when you are away - I could not recommend these more highly.  I also have a Tapo camera so I can check on my dogs whilst I am out, thats good too.  Go Tapo!",5,17/12/2024,United Kingdom

R1R1CFV2DPVWNO,"I am physically disabled and use a manual wheelchair.Not every Tapo device is in reach, as my daughter installed them and I did the rest.The failsafe is a switch on the side that when two are placed together my cane will not fit between to press it.A poorly thought out design. Means if you use a 4 gang extension lead only two sockets can be fitted!They connect almost instantly to the Tapo app but one socket did require a long 5 second press to engage the pairing mode.Not sure if it was previously returned and sent out as new on my order having not been flashed in the refurb department.I don't buy refurbished, I buy new but it doesn't stop Amazon pulling a fast one on Prime Day.If you buy the Tapo Hub to work with the infrared sensor expect the Hub to disconnect the whole WiFi throughout your home at random.Even with the firmware update it still misbehaves but once it's unplugged from its socket, everything is back online instantly.It's a flawed concept to suggest WiFi apps and gadgets work for the disabled via voice control.It may sound good but unless you are a computer programmer like me, you will be massively disappointed because a lot of it is tat, like the Philips Hue system and it costs considerably more.If your mobility isn't an issue then maybe this problematic system is to your liking.Just don't rely upon these on equipment that your life depends on a permanent connection like a CPAP machine.Always check the current requirements of your device before using these as they may catch fire when, they create an open circuit bypassing your breaker switch in the consumer board.I tested mine for resistance before my daughter plugged them in.Living alone means I have to be extra careful because my daughter doesn't want to walk in on a very crisply-burnt father!",3,21/07/2024,United Kingdom

R29ZBCJ4KEVG15,"I've got three Kasa sockets set up and I had no problems with them.  Unfortunately, I got confused and thought I was buying more of the same.  I spend £28 on a box of four.  None of them can be found (""We couldn't find this Tapo device"") and I'm following all the instructions on resetting and bluetooth and all that.So, I reckon I'll box them back up and ask my friends if they want to try them.  Else, they are going back.Changed my mind.  13.01.2022Why?  Well, eventually the app worked and found the new Tapo plugs.  Now, also, I have realised something significantly difference between these Tapo plugs and their Kasa equivalents.  When power is restored to them, either after the consumer unit/fusebox has been off or the switch on the socket has been off, they can be programmed to come back online without actually turning on.The device settings, for the Kasa KP105s that I have, is minimal, with LED status (whether the LEDs stay on or not) and name/icon.  Turn the power back on - the devices plugged into Kasa adapters come on.The device settings, for the Tapo P100s, have a default state option which includes 'off'.This may not seem like a big deal but if, like me, you're on economy seven and your mystery phantom load is doing your head in - you may like to just switch everything off at the consumer unit during peak rate times.  It can make a difference of £1 a day in electricity bills.  With the Kasa adapters - everything turns on and the energy use goes way up until one is able to get on the apps and turn everything off again.  Tapo have the default 'off' state option, though.  This is good.  I might get more.  I'm sorry I didn't see this earlier and that I didn't come back when the Tapo app noticed my new adapters because they are, in turns out, very efficient for my needs.Now, I have other Tapo and Kasa devices.  The bulbs all work fine.  It might not be TP Links fault that these sockets don't work in my setup.  There may be some small print I have missed.  What IS TP Link's fault is that they are running, side by side, Tapo AND Kasa instead of merging their two varieties.  I can't easily tell the differences.  There seem to be some things the Tapo bulbs can do, that the Kasa can't, and vice versa.  Why not just make one range?  Then we won't be accidentally buying things designed to not work alongside what we already have.The bulbs, on the other hand, are a completely inverted situation.  Kasa BULBS can get set to come on, after a power outage, in the off condition.  Tapo bulbs can only come on as either the previous on setting or as a predefined colour/brightness.So, if I was starting out with the automation all over again, I'd have Kasa bulbs and Tapo plug adapters.  I think that's the right way round...",5,23/11/2021,United Kingdom

R2TQ7KF66GDREA,"I must acknowledge the customer service team's kindness and prompt response, for which I've added a star. However, my concerns regarding the product and company practices remain.My Orthopedic Surgeon and Physiotherapist both expressed skepticism about the product's claims and even showed me these Akusoli insoles they’d ordered from Amazon. As I mentioned I was waiting on an order.The insoles significantly underdeliver on their advertised benefits:No Magnetic Pain Relief: The purported magnets exhibit no magnetic properties. Furthermore, the metal inclusions feel like pebbles within the shoe, causing considerable discomfort.Lack of ""Instant Comfort Boost"": The insoles are cheaply constructed, a fact apparent upon initial inspection.False ""Massaging Foot Support"" Claim: This advertised feature is entirely inaccurate.Despite ordering in November, I have yet to receive my order. However, the samples I tried proved to be unwearable due to the aforementioned issues.Furthermore, I am deeply concerned by Akusoli's aggressive marketing tactics.The auto-payment setup was activated without my consent at the time of purchase.Additionally, they have been sending unsolicited spam emails to an email address I never provided or subscribed to, with no ""Unsubscribe"" option – a clear breach of EU GDPR regulations, which mandate explicit consent for marketing emails and the availability of an ""Unsubscribe"" link. This intrusive and unsolicited behavior is the primary reason for this review.I've contacted, Cancelled Auto-billing and requested Full Refund from Akusoli.",1,10/12/2024,United Kingdom

R1V9JZJDLKN31P,"I know it sounds absolutely crazy but these bulbs set off my house alarm. They cause some kind of interference with my front door sensor. I'm not talking about the bulb setting off the alarm when it's set. I'm talking about the alarm coming up with a fault with the front door sensor and then setting off the alarm when it's not even set! It says the battery is low in the sensor, but it's not. I have replaced the battery and believe me, I have explored every other possibility and I have done multiple tests. I refused to believe it at first because it's just so unbelievably ridiculous but I am now 100% sure it's the bulbs.If you have a ""Risco"" alarm with wireless sensors, you should probably avoid these bulbs!Otherwise, they're actually a great product and super easy to set up lolGood colours and functionality. They even automatically set themselves up for smart speaker use with both Alexa and Google. Brilliant product, except for interference with my alarm system!I'm still mind blown.",3,11/10/2024,United Kingdom
R2BUAM0NPF9DL8,"I’ve been using the Tapo Smart Bulb for a while now, and I’m really happy with it! The setup was super easy—just screw it in, connect it to the Tapo app, and you’re good to go. No need for a separate hub, which is a big plus.The app is simple and intuitive, allowing me to adjust brightness, set schedules, and even control the light when I’m not home using the Away Mode. It also works perfectly with Alexa, so I can just ask to turn the light on or off without lifting a finger.Another great feature is Device Sharing, so my family can control the light too. The bulb itself is bright and energy-efficient, making it a great choice for smart home setups.Overall, if you’re looking for an affordable and reliable smart bulb, this one is definitely worth considering!",5,01/02/2025,United Kingdom
R3IORM9UTOI3BI,"Easy to fit and connect to my WiFi, not so easy to connect to my Alexa. These bulbs replaced other (working) smart bulbs which decided to disconnect more times than they actually worked. Be aware if like me you want to replace with another app and use the same names i.e kitchen 1 etc, then you actually have to remove the ‘skill’ on Alexa and physically add the Tapo skill as Alexa found my bulbs repeatedly but they were unresponsive. All a bit confusing but I got there in the end!",4,16/03/2025,United Kingdom
RHWO2YL44W25E,I purchased these after alot of thought about if I wanted to start automating the house. These bulbs were my first smart purchase as I already had Alexa devices to use to control them. I was pleasantly surprised! I purchased these just before Christmas 2024 and after a fairly easy setup (don't be put off if they don't connect to your setup first time just try again with your phone closer and they will connect and work perfectly after that) spent the next hour trying out all the different colours and light levels and I was very pleased. The cost was not too expensive to buy as a decent LED bulb is almost the same cost anyway. They are well made and don't feel like they are going to break putting them in the sockets.After using these I purchased 2 more to use elsewhere in the house and now I have bulbs and smart sockets all round the house all made by Tapo.I would highly recommend the Tapo brand as I have had zero issues with anything I have bought so far.,5,16/02/2025,United Kingdom
R1JZBO9DHBYOQL,"Absolutely LOVE these! I have put one in my living room, and the other in my bedroom and now both are activated by Alexa, simply by my telling Alexa to turn on the light! Love It! So pleased with this purchase, easy to purchase, great value for money, fairly easy to install and set up…what’s not to like?!!!!",5,25/03/2025,United Kingdom
R2QFNXT76S33FH,"The set-up for this is quite complicated for an IT novice.Thankfully I am not.But..It regularly loses the router connection even though other connected devices show a strong signal.In order to maintain control of the device, you have to turn it on and off via the application.This is absolutely not practical.People are turning lights on and off at the wall.The control app is unreliable. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't do anything, even though it shows as connected.The lowest light intensity setting is too high.On the bright side (intended..) it does display very vivid colours and the pre-set themes are OK.My daughter likes the light in her room.As a basic light, without colours, it is actually OK. Once you set the intensity, warmth and colour, it always comes on with that setting.If i were to purchase such an item again, I may go for a more expensive, well established brand.",4,05/01/2025,United Kingdom
R3OC62GPDAS0Y,"Been using these for a couple days now. I have them linked to the Tapo app and Home Assistant (I'm still very knew to Home Assistant and the whole ""smart home"" thing)It works great but both bulbs I ordered have randomly disconnected on me, ONCE (so far). When this happened and when I turned them on, it would flash the lights as if the bulb was still in setup mode, so when this happened I needed to connect to their Wi-Fi hotspot and re-link them to the app and everything. (Home assistant automatically picked them up and re-linked them though so that's great)I also tested them, and they work without internet so that's great! However you will still probably need an internet connection to actually link them to the Tapo app because you will need to make an account, so that means if the company goes bankrupt and purge all their servers, if a bulb goes offline then you probably won't be able to re-configure them, idk tbh.If you're buying these lights, you should probably invest in their Tapo smart switches (or any smart switch for that matter). Remember, not all smart switches will work, you will probably need to find a DECOUPLED smart switch that does NOT cut off the power to the actual bulb. And then you will need to make an automation of sorts yourself. (The Tapo smart switches have a decoupled mode so you could just buy those I guess, but do your own research as well)Oh side note; If you're like me and want to set colours via RGB or hex codes, you cannot do that via the Tapo app, which is a huge disappointment. Also, party mode doesn't exist in the Tapo app anymore (?)Not to worry though. You can do all that with Home Assistant so I would recommend you set that up as well if you're serious about getting these bulbs all around your house.",4,19/10/2024,United Kingdom

I have multiple all around the house, and have even gifted them to family.The bulbs are smart so you’ll need to download the app on your phone — which essentially turns your phone into a remote control that control the on-off function of the bulbs and their colour and intensity.No more feeling the walls in the dark in hope of finding that light switch to turn on the lights; no more getting out of bed because I forgot to turn a light off. I can now just turn any light on and off at home from my mobile phone — I can do this from the comfort of my own bed, or from the comfort of a bed in a hotel on the other side of the world.The app is great — easy to use and intuitive. And although I’ve only use the colour function to change the colour of the light during Halloween, it’s a great function to have just in case you need it.

They're fairly simple to set up but I had an issue with one of mine at first, which I think was down to me. I could only get one of them to work on my phone while it couldn't find the other one. I don't know if it says it anywhere on Tapos app, but if you ever want to reboot the light bulbs again turn the light switch on and off 5 times and wait 1 second inbetween each switch. That can be very useful to remember! I mostly bought them for the regular colours, but the multicolour bulbs were an added bonus!",5,23/01/2025,United Kingdom

I have returned as faulty but will reorder hoping it was a 1 off faulty bulb!Will update after recieving and using the new bulbs.**** returned and reordered with no problems.

Here's a comparison of the two:1. Device Compatibility: The Kasa app is designed for managing TP-Link smart home devices such as smart plugs, smart switches, and smart bulbs. It supports a wider range of TP-Link devices compared to the Tapo app, which is specifically tailored for Tapo series devices like smart bulbs, smart plugs, and security cameras.2.

RBC7N1HW23JSA,"Plenty bright for a reasonably sized room when using white light. My rooms are 4x5 yards and I find that a brightness setting 25% is comfortable for most tasks. According to my smart meter this only uses a couple of watts.Set up was easy. One the account was created the Tapo app talks you through the process complete with diagrams. I did have a problem initialising one of the bulbs which it refused to add to the virtual network. Reading the troubleshooting guide the app presented told me that I shouldn't be running a VPN while initialising the bulb. Turned it off and hey presto. The VPN doesn't affect interacting with the bulb after it has been initialised and added to your home network.Timers and schedules are stored on the bulb, so you don't have to have an active network or mobile device available once these are set up.You can easily configure what the bulb does when it is switched on. It can use the same colour and brightness setting it was using when it was switched off or it can default to any colour and brightness you specify. Means that you don't have to fiddle around with a device when you turn it on at the wall.There are some weaknesses. The themes, which let you have the bulb changing colour continuously, aren't great. They either switch directly from one colour to another or fade towards black, change colour and brighten again. Missing is an option to move smoothly through the colour spectrum from one colour to the next - even my dumb 16 colour bulb with a remote control can do that, so it's strange this can't. It also doesn't seem to be possible to set a theme as the default on setting which means you can't use a schedule to have the bulb switch on running a theme. The gradual on/off setting isn't gradual enough - it takes under a second. It would be nice if you could set how long it takes to go from off to your desired brightness and vice versa. One can only hope that a future software update may correct some of these weaknesses.",4,05/12/2023,United Kingdom

R1V9Z0KY2VP2PL,"I bought this, after buying another TAPO product recently, and because I had the app on my phone and ally information was already stored, it took seconds to set up.Just in case this is your first one, here are some tips I learned the hard way the first time I set a TAPO device up.....1: do not plug it in until you have the app installed and open and ready to add a device.2. The very first thing you need to do is download and install the app, then follow the instructions to set up an account, then follow the instructions to set up a device...3: when it says "" turn on location"" as an optional choice, Turn on location, it will not pair of location is off, now you might always have your location switched on, in which case this will not bother you, but if like me you are not constantly broadcasting your location, it is a must. After much to and fro with the support team, I figured this out, not them, so I asked them to either fix the back end or make location a must not an optional setting.3: you will need to know, before you start, your network password, your Google/ Alexa password of you are linking it.Note: if you already have a device set up And you selected "" remember my network password"" the first time, for every new device you don't have to go hunting down your network/ braodband password, which is great.Also the second device just paired with Google and Alexa without any input from me, which is also great ( for me Google home picked up the second device before Alexa, and spoke to me through my Google speaker to let me know it was connected, and then Alexa chimed in to say they were also connected to the new device )4: you need to go to your internet settings on your phone/ computer, whichever device you are using the TAPO app on,  and select the TAPO network when it tells you to, not to worry it doesn't switch off your connection to your own router, anyone who has set up similar devices will know this, but the app does hint at this but doesn't make it clear so I mentioned it here.The light has two main buttons, white or colour, the white, is as standard that harsh white light, however, the tutorial shows you how to set up custom colours that it remembers so I fiddled with the really user friendly colour wheel until I got a warm white shade I liked, and that was it, now it stays on that, unless I chose another colour, but even then my custom colour( or colours as you can set up lots) stay stored with an icon showing you the colour you chose, so it is never more than a clock away.The integration with Google home and Alexa ( I have both, because, you know different things for different purposes) is seamless, once you popped your password in and confirmed once, the next device just connects without bother, so if you are replacing all your bulbs you don't have to do a big begging set up for each one.Each bulb or other tapi device is shown in the app, and you can tell the app where they are, so that you can easily turn them on individually, change colours individually, change brightness individually, and control them with voice controls if you have a voice input Google ( Google home & compatible device like speakers or your android phones voice through Google assistant, Alexa echo or other Alexa voice control like an app on your phone)Therefore you can exit the house saying turn off the lights and keep the pitch light on, or also say "" turn off the lights in little Jimmy's room , like if you want them to go to bed""",5,15/12/2022,United Kingdom
R34AN0SL6H93SX,"For this price band, it is extremely good. Very easy to install, especially if you are already a Tapo user/customer. You can literally connect it with your Tapo app, and start enjoying making the most out of the smart features. You can create automation using the bulbs and your camera. Colours are all very nice. It could be a lot better tho. The brightness can be a little bit better. It can flicker when it is on low brightness levels. I think the most annoying part is the limitations on colour selection. It works wonders with the preset colour options and I'm sure it supports millions of colours but the section in the app you can change the colour is almost impossible to use. I wish the app was allowing us to use HEX or RGB codes to pick a colour. Overall for this price, it's lovely. Buy a Tapo camera and some LED stripes. You and your neighbours will be impressed. Be careful tho, you wouldn't want your neighbours to call the police on you for having aliens in the house",4,01/06/2024,United Kingdom
R140PKD7H6876R,"I bought two of these bulbs and brought one with me to my holiday flat abroad. I can't set it up with the app, because although the instructions claim that the QR code is on the bulb and on the box, it is not. Can anyone assist in getting a new QR code in order to set it up with Alexa. Currently I can only control from the Tapo app. Thanks",3,01/02/2025,United Kingdom

R18VO8K6N1RH8F,unfortunately as soon as set up and switched on i could see they weren't bright enough. I should have paid attention to the lumens. 800 is simply not enough for a room even a reading lamp probably needs a brighter light. The set up functionality was fine and the color options are an interesting gimmick. I returned them. Had they had an option of perhaps 1200-1500 lumen i would have probably kept them.,3,19/01/2025,United Kingdom

R3K5OIVC3ISSY7,"BulbI recently purchased the Tapo Smart Bulb and I have been extremely impressed with its performance. As someone who is always looking for ways to make my home more efficient and convenient, this smart bulb has been a game changer.First of all, the installation process was incredibly easy. All I had to do was screw in the bulb, download the Tapo app, and connect the bulb to my WiFi network. It took less than 5 minutes and I was able to control the bulb with my phone right away.One of the best features of this smart bulb is the ability to change the color and brightness. I love being able to adjust the lighting to fit my mood or the occasion. The range of colors is impressive and the brightness can go from dim to very bright, making it perfect for any setting.The Tapo app also allows for scheduling and automation. I can set the bulb to turn on and off at certain times, which is great for when I am away from home. I can also create scenes and routines, so the bulb turns on and off in a certain pattern. This has been especially helpful in creating a relaxing and cozy atmosphere in my bedroom.One of the biggest advantages of having a WiFi smart bulb is the ability to control it from anywhere. I no longer have to get out of bed to turn off the lights, I can just use my phone. This has also been helpful when I forget to turn off the lights after leaving the house, I can simply do it remotely.The Tapo Smart Bulb is also compatible with voice assistants such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, which is a great added convenience. I can now control the lights with just my voice, making it even easier to use.Overall, I highly recommend the Tapo Smart Bulb for anyone looking to make their home smarter and more efficient. It is easy to install, has a wide range of features, and has made my life much more convenient. I will definitely be purchasing more for other rooms in my house.",5,10/03/2024,United Kingdom

RNXT8IPS4XSH7,"The Tapo smart bulb is incredibly easy to set up and works seamlessly with Alexa, making it a great addition to a smart home. You can control the light through the Tapo app, which lets you adjust brightness and choose from a range of colors to set the right ambiance. This two-pack of bulbs is a convenient choice if you’re looking for simple home automation.With Alexa integration, you can schedule the bulbs to turn on and off automatically, which is especially useful when you’re away from home. The Tapo app also provides detailed information about the bulbs’ status and energy consumption, helping you monitor usage.Since these are Wi-Fi bulbs, they don’t support Zigbee, which would be a nice addition for those with Zigbee-based systems. However, they’re still compatible with other hubs, making automation easy to set up.

R1KQLN2S0KMXNS,"I think what I like most about these bulbs are that they also behave like normal bulbs, meaning that if you switch it on/off at the wall they don't stay in the previous state, but instead go back to behaving like normal.

Highly recommend for anyone looking to upgrade their lighting.",4,19/09/2024,United Kingdom
R1IFXYB0YNGGPJ,"I bought 4 L530e bulbs for my new outdoor garden wall lights. My main reason for getting these was so that I could control them from inside my house, as the new garden lights are on the garage circuit which is physically switched at the garage.My first gripe is that the advertised brightness is 800 lumens, but the brightness isn't quite as high as that, which I compare to a standard LED bulb with the same rated brightness.I also had issues with connectivity, although the two that kept dropping the WIFI signal were on the rear wall of the garage and therefore it is likely this was the main factor in that connectivity issue, as the other 2 lights are on the side wall and therefore have direct line of sight to the house where the nearest WIFI access point is.I have now raised a return and have bought the L535e version, which is rated at 1055 lumens and therefore brighter (which I can confirm in the case).",4,04/03/2024,United Kingdom

R166P1UCKZTIMA,"I bought these for external lights, 2 out the back and a porch light.  I connected each and set up as required, but whenever I turn them back on they are back in sync model, they keep disconnecting themselves from the internet and then are no longer showing as an available device in the app and I have now got to the point where I can no longer be bothered to re-sync as what is the point as they disconnect again whenever they feel like it.  I had Wifi extenders placed within feet of them, though I do appreciate that the bulbs are linked to outside lights, but if they didn't work they would have synced in the first place.I thought these would be great for coming back home of an evening and turning back lights on when I park up, but sadly as they wont retain their internet connect they are just expensive dumb bulbs.",2,12/02/2025,United Kingdom

RPATIO3J21Y7A,"I recently tried out the Tapo Smart Bulb, and while it has its positives, there are also some issues to consider. On the bright side, it fits perfectly into my standard light socket, just as I expected. The accompanying app is also user-friendly, making it easy to control the bulb's settings and schedule.However, there have been a few instances where the bulb hasn't responded immediately to commands from the app, which can be frustrating. Even more concerning is that it has randomly turned on in the middle of the night on occasion, which has disrupted my sleep.Overall, while the Tapo Smart Bulb offers convenience and ease of use, its occasional responsiveness issues and unexpected activations have left me with mixed feelings about its reliability.",4,27/04/2024,United Kingdom

REMDNPYTHRYDS,"I have had this for a long while now and felt it was finally time for a review.As an independent reviewer (a normal average everyday person) and not a product tester, I should point out that I’m quite particular about things and won’t mince my words.So, this bulb is definitely smart. Not cheap, not expensive but a reasonable price in the current market at the time of writing this. I wasn’t sure about going down this road of smart bulbs and other smart devices,  it I’m glad I did.It arrived quickly and well packaged, and looks like - well, a bulb.Setup was quick and easy, following the Tapo app you download to go with the bulb. Once set up it was an easy task to go into the Alexa app, find the smart bulb and link the Alexa app and Tapo app to give full voice control.It has many colour settings, plus a couple of preprogrammed settings including a party mode if you want multi colours flashing lights, not really for me though.It’s fully dimmable, either via the app or Alexa voice control: just say “Alexa, smart bulb to 20%” and just like that it becomes 20% or whatever percentage of light you want. At full brightness this bulb gives out plenty of light, and you can adjust the colour to suit your mood or if you have light sensitive eyes.Over all I’m really impressed with this, and as I said I’m glad I decided to go down this route.",5,03/02/2024,United Kingdom
R5A8RH6U2DMDY,I bought this smart bulb from Amazon for my outdoor porch light. So I can work it from my Alexa app on my iPhone. This is one of the best things I’ve done. I would recommend you try this smart bulb for your self. Great product from Amazon.,5,09/12/2024,United Kingdom

R11ZTK93OO9DYU,"I recently purchased the Tapo Smart Bulb, Smart Wi-Fi LED Light, and I must say I am thoroughly impressed with its performance and functionality. This smart bulb is a game-changer in terms of convenience and energy efficiency.One of the standout features of this smart bulb is its compatibility with Amazon Alexa and Google Home, allowing for seamless integration into a smart home ecosystem. With simple voice commands, I can easily control the brightness and color of the bulb, creating the perfect ambiance for any occasion.Setting up the Tapo Smart Bulb was a breeze, as it requires no hub for operation. I simply downloaded the Tapo app, connected the bulb to my Wi-Fi network, and I was ready to go. The app itself is user-friendly and offers a wide range of customization options, such as scheduling timers, adjusting color temperatures, and creating scenes.In terms of energy efficiency, the Tapo Smart Bulb is a winner. With a power consumption of only 60W, I have noticed a significant decrease in my energy bills since switching to this smart bulb. The ability to dim the light and set timers also helps to further conserve energy.The color-changing feature of the bulb is a fun addition, allowing me to set the mood with a variety of colors to choose from. Whether I want a bright white light for working or a soft warm light for relaxing, the Tapo Smart Bulb delivers.Overall, I highly recommend the Tapo Smart Bulb, Smart Wi-Fi LED Light to anyone looking to upgrade their lighting setup.

R3OP7NOF0SR0JY,"Decided to switch from testing the cheaper Govee alternative (which would flicker randomly) to Tapo as I use plenty of Kasa/Tapo smart plugs throughout the house. I had high hopes for this light bulb but unfortunately it wasn't a great as i'd thought it would be. Using Scenes is limited, practically unsupported over Alexa and doesn't give you the range the previous Govee had. To make matters worse, the transistion between cycling colours is awful, the light just seems to do a hard switch between the colour even if you set it to ""breathing"" and reduce the speed. If you drop the brightness it just wants to practically turn off between each colour. I've decided now to give Wiz a go as that also support Matter and has other features such as built proximty awareness. If you want a simple colour change, this will do, but any features beyond leaving it on one colour I wouldn't really bother.",2,05/02/2025,United Kingdom

They are brilliant now, as long as everyone remembers to use Alexa or the app rather than the switch!Great to be able to adjust brightness and colour while baby is asleep, without talking and using the app. There is also a party mode which flashes all the colours, pretty good for a kitchen disco 🤩",5,09/10/2024,United Kingdom

R33P6I6KT14GVA,"I have a talktalk router which broadcasts 5ghz and 2.4ghz bands at the same time.I bought 5 of these bulbs, three of them connected via the Tapo App relatively easily, the other two I could not get to connect. It always went through to the pairing stage of the setup process and then failed.I tried turning off the 5ghz band on my talktalk router via the admin backend. But this didn't work. After multiple attempts including swapping the bulbs around, I gave up and was considering sending them back. However at the time I was also looking for better wifi coverage in my home so despite my experience and with some reservations I bought the TP-Link Deco X20 AX1800 Mesh wifi system on Prime day. This set up very easily and it gave me the ability through the Deco app to turn off the 5ghz wifi with a simple button, and then once that was done I managed to connect the last two Tapo bulbs easily. (they still wouldn't connect with the 5ghz band active even through the Deco routers).I find it a bit strange that every other device I have that uses the 2.4ghz network has had no problem connecting to my original router and yet these bulbs seem to have a problem, and also why some connected and some didn't, hence why I give this product a 4 star rating.Now they are connected I am very happy with the light they put out, the Tapo app is easy enough to use and allows you to set up different shortcuts to turn on/off the lights in the various colours etc as well as other useful options such as grouping them by room/name and automation options like turn off lights at midnight, turn on at sunset etc.I also like the way they integrate with alexa automatically getting detected and then voice control is possible as well as alexa suggesting routines that you might like to use.",4,20/07/2022,United Kingdom

R1EGSJ4CFWD7B9,"I bought this mat to place on the tiles just inside the external conservatory door. I chose the anthracite 40 cm by 60 cm from the several options available.It arrived rolled up with sticky tape, and when opened out, it didn’t lie flat, which concerned me. After leaving it overnight, a couple of creases still remained. To help it flatten, I placed it on the floor in front of the living room fire, and after another day or so, it settled perfectly flat. Phew. A helpful tip: be patient for a couple of days, as it needs time to flatten down 😉The underside has a textured rubber surface that provides a non-slip effect. I tested it (see video above) by rubbing my feet on it quite vigorously, and it adhered to the floor very well, although this may depend on the type of flooring. In terms of trip hazard safety, it is excellent The rubber edges are tapered, leaving virtually no lip to catch on. I deliberately scuffed the toes of my shoes against the edge, and they just slid across without snagging.My conservatory opens outward, but if you're planning to place the mat under an inward-opening door, I tested it under my garage back door for clearance (see photo above). There is a gap of roughly half an inch (12 mm) between the door’s  bottom edge and the floor, and it cleared easily without brushing its surface at all, so this mat could be a suitable choice for that type of position.The top surface is short but reasonably soft and feels sturdy, effectively cleaning the soles of my shoes when I come in from the garden.The quality is what I hoped for; I found no imperfections upon arrival, and it feels tough, waterproof, and durable. All good so far.- Pros:• Reasonable price; good value for money.• Neat and smart appearance.• Durable; looks almost new after five months.• Versatile, practical thickness allows opening doors to clear easily.• Machine and hose washable for easy cleaning.• Good slip & trip resistance.- Cons:• Required a couple of days to flatten before use.• The thin pile, versus coir type, may not suit everyone unless door clearance is a consideration.After using this mat regularly for five months, it still looks pretty much as good as the day it arrived, so it’s five stars from me.I hope you found this review helpful.",5,07/10/2024,United Kingdom

RA0XF6J6XM8I4,"I wanted a kmat for my back door which would actually remove dirt from shoes and boots when people rubbed their feet on it. As we live in a coastal resort, there's always a lot of sand from the local beaches being walked in.I've had several other mats which were useless at cleaning shoes and was fed up with dirt, stones and sand being walked in through the kitchen.This is the first mat that has done what it's supposed to do, it cleans the majority of dirt off shoes and I've found there's  a lot less being walked in.There's a good selection of colours for this rug and i chose a lovely anthracite colour which blends in with my tiles.It came folded up rather than rolled up which was good as I'd no curled up edges to flatten out.I'm disabled and in a wheelchair so i like the fact it doesn't have a deep pile so I can use my long handled brush and shovel to give it a good clean.The negative points I'd have to make is, this is described as being heavy duty. I don't have a lot of upper body strength but I find this mat quite light. I've had a lot heavier mats in the past.Also I have  this mat on tiles, and although it's supposed to be non slip, it moves about all over the place. I would put this down to the fact it's so light.I find the fact it really does clean shoes makes it well worth the money.It's just a pity it moves about so easily.",5,25/12/2024,United Kingdom

R3DF21L42PFO1P,Unfortunately this mat had been folded into quarters and sealed in a small bag. Consequently the creases prevented it from lying flat which posed a serious hazard. It has taken me time and effort to gently heat the rubber backing with a hair dryer and walk up and down on it. A mat this small could have been delivered flat or even rolled. The mat is now fine as it should be.,4,05/01/2025,United Kingdom

After using this mattress ""topper"" I can say its little more than a duvet. It is way to soft to give any support at all. I'm 19 stone mind so for a person a lot lighter than me it maybe fine but for me, I couldn't tell the difference between this and my daughter's single duvet.I havnt returned it as it isn't faulty. It is an extremely warm cover though!I think I'll need to try a memory foam type from somewhere but this will likely need to be ""tried"" in a store before I buy next time.Don't be put off by my update though. If your a lot lighter than me this will add a layer of plushness to your mattress but at my weight it gives little support.Just my thoughts mind.",4,28/10/2024,United Kingdom

R2X9B4QD4PWP9B,"I can't believe it took me so long to buy this. For months I've had issues with my mattress where turning over during the night has felt more like I'm brushing myself against sandpaper. This has completely solved that.It was easy to fit and is quite stable; it doesn't slip around very much at all. I cannot feel my mattress underneath the topper whatsoever. It's like my bed is made of marshmallows. Suffice it to say, I drifted off to sleep within minutes of getting into bed last night. Absolutely sensational.",5,24/11/2024,United Kingdom

R1Y1GFK47LNZ7J,"Few years ago I bought a mattress - ended up getting one too hard for me and it's been causing me hip issues sleeping on my side.I've read that if I don't want to change a mattress I should try the topper. It's taken me way too long to purchase it, but I'm so glad I did!I bought the thickest one available and my hip pain disappeared on day one!This topper is absolutely amazing and I highly recommend it. It has bands in the corner that are easy to get it settled on the mattress so it doesn't slip. It's very soft and comfortable.",5,21/10/2024,United Kingdom

R1LWT6QX5SAK69,"I purchased a new mattress last year, from one of those well-known companies that sell mattresses that come folded up. There were no offers of firm mattress (it was a sale) and so had to opt for medium-which I can tolerate enough times.It seemed fine for the first two months or so, but then started to sag in the middle and become uncomfortable.I was waking up every morning with a backache, and so considered getting a mattress topper.I wanted one that was pretty thick and firm and purchased this one.I've got to say right off the bat, it was great and firmed up the mattress.Backaches are all gone now and sleep is more comfortable.",4,25/03/2024,United Kingdom

R2DW7FWDDPIG4X,The cushion is great but looks even better with the cover on. I would prefer a more robust material for the cover which is why I only gave it 4 stars. It's a bit thin. Happy with it though because the price wasn't high. I bought 2 as my husband and I both got the cushions for Christmas.,4,07/01/2025,United Kingdom
R3H9SUOXB45FVM,"I was having problems with sciatica across my bottom, so I bought one of these cushions, and it's a lot better since I've been using it. I think I saw it on T.V. sometime, and wrote the name down.  Then a while later I got round to buying one. I got a cover which I think it needs. I soon ordered one for my daughter because of her Job as a Teaching assistant. She's sitting on small hard School chairs most days. She has problems with her hip muscles. I'm hoping this will help her, as She's in a lot of pain. Would I buy it again? I already have. It's great. I could have done with one years ago.

RXA2COG0EA9DQ,I think this falls very much into the category of ‘do I send this back or persevere with it’. I bought this to cushion a swivel chair which was too inflexible to be comfortable over long periods and I’m not convinced this makes it any more comfortable. Granted it is very flexible and this might well be its Achilles Heel. It is so squishable it offers very little padding. I felt it had compressed so much that there seemed to be little extra between me and the chair. I doubt if it would be much good if I needed to kneel on it on a hard surface.,2,23/02/2025,United Kingdom

R1DHKD5NDKY4UW,"This is an upgrade for me from the Show 8 which I've had for some time and love.As we have existing products I had this one ready to join our existing group.It's really easy and straightforward to set up. One of the features I really like is that you can set it to move with you as you move in a room. For example in the kitchen it will move with me as I go about my cooking or cleaning so the screen is always visible. The large screen makes it easy to pop on the TV or read a recipe and the sound is clear and easily changed in volume. Definitely worth the money, especially when bought on an offer!",5,18/06/2024,United Kingdom

R26P162WYP7G5J,Got this as i work away most of the time. And wife wanted something to be able to see the front door Ring camera. And watch things on.Also handy for us to talk/ video call while I'm away..It's also handy for keeping an eye on our Parrots 🦜  while we are out.It's like a little pet that sits in corner.. responds when you talk to it. And will turn to follow you.There are some limitations and things that could be better.  But then you are always finding new things you can do with it.Sound quality is bit heavy in Base. But is good.Picture quality is good.So I'd say it was a good purchase for us. Very happy with it.,5,03/10/2024,United Kingdom
R1NGUV5ZBWVXCF,"Wow an Amazon Echo that moves, should be fantastic right. Well in many respects it is, but they really have let this horse out of the stable before it can run.There are some great features:Much improved screen resolution compared to the Show 10 2nd Gen.Comparable or slightly better sound compared to the Show 10.That's about it for the better features.Oh nearly forgot, the camera is a lot better.Most features are about the same as on the previous echo show 10.However, the headline feature, the movement is a massive let down.I have now tried this in 2 locations and have had issues in both.I find that sometimes it turns all the way to it's rear most position for no apparent reason. I think it may be ashamed of itself??It tracks very erratically. I was on a video call yesterday and instead of smoothly tracking me (I was sat down at the time) it was moving around like a drunk trying to sit on a bar stool.I get the impression that both specific location and light levels effect the movement massively. And before you say it Amazon, no we should not have to contact you for technical support. This is a mainstream product that most people should be able to use with ease, not require a degree to calibrate correctly.Now for the camera position, who thought it would be a great idea to put it in the corner of the display???What were they consuming on that particular day? When tracking the entire screen looks over my left shoulder. I think it may be seeing ghost's??? Or perhaps it simply cannot line up easily as the camera is mounted on the right of the screen?Low light, oh dear ""expletive"". In normal evening light (where you and I can see clearly) you lose the movement all together. Did they only test this in a lab with super bright lighting. Didn't anyone take it home to test???You can also use it for a remote security camera. Great eh? Well only if the room is super well lit and the unit is not in Do Not Disturb mode. Ahhhhh, What is going on. I have 2 other Pan and Tilt cameras (not made by Amazon) and these can move it total darkness. So why do I need 10,000 lumens to operate this camera????I have another big bug bare. I have this Echo show in my living room and I have the new Show 15 in my kitchen. The closest Echo should respond to you, when they are both set as Alexa. When I am next to the living room Echo the kitchen Echo responds virtually all the time. I have now had to rename my kitchen echo show to ""echo"" to prevent some serious echo abuse! They are approx. 6 metres apart and this even happens when the kitchen door is closed.So what do I think and would I buy another? Well if you ignore the movement side of things then this is a great Echo Show. The screen is great and you can really see the difference when the show 10 2nd gen and 3rd gen are next to each other. But the movement side of things is so poor that I am considering sending mine back.If you already have an Echo Show 10 second gen I would not upgrade. If you are looking at a totally new large echo show then maybe it is worth it, but I would also consider the show 15 if lots of base is not important to you.So my message to Amazon is fix the issue with the movement issues then this will be a great addition to a smart home, as it is I would recommend either the Echo show 10 2nd gen or the new Show 15, which I am very impressed with.",4,18/12/2021,United Kingdom
RMKYA7K904Y3E,"I am a serious Alexa convert.  This was an upgrade from my first echo.  Really easy to set up with the app and i love the way it recognises it’s either me or my wife in the room.Lots of features which you expect with the added bonus it moves so when making a video call and I’m in the kitchen being busy the screen follows me so I’m always in view.  The rotation is about 340 degrees.The picture quality is spot on and the sound is great for a small speaker., whether playing music or making a call.Seems very sturdy by design so top marks from me.",5,06/10/2024,United Kingdom
R1KHYC9TLVL6YV,"This is an amazing piece of kit! The 10.1 inch Screen is bright with very sharp images and I love the motion tracking feature. (This really impressed my wife- she now loves this and all my other Echo products around the house).Set-up is simple if you have an Amazon account and it has to be placed on a flat secure surface or it notifies you and goes idle, until it is secure. It has a very wide turning circle so give it a clear space either side.I haven't set up the Echo to Echo video feature with the Echo Show 8 in the Living Room room. (I want to surprise my wife with this feature) so we have that to look forward to very soon.It is very expensive though, but I feel a very worth while investment, especially if you don't want to pay for a high grade speaker system.It feels sturdy, but is not too heavy and looks fantastic with it's simple styling and set up giving it a futuristic look and feel.The sound quality is excellent too and being able to watch Netflix and Prime Video is just great.This is by far the best Echo Show model I have seen, to date and I love it!Update: I have now tried the video chat and it works a treat. My wife is very pleased she doesn't always have to msg me if I'm in my ""study"" and we can chat face-to-face.  The screen image is excellent and the sound is really good too!!",5,14/05/2021,United Kingdom
RB0JYARKK5SRA,"I bought this to replace our previous Echo Show 10 model. While there are definitely some big improvements, it still feels as though the newest Echo Show 10 is missing some basic features that I would have expected to be included in newer models by now.So let's start with what's better than the previous model:1) Processing power - unlike the previous model, this one doesn't stutter or freeze. It handles things pretty smoothly.2) It moves - it's a handy feature in an open plan room, especially in a kitchen/ diner, where you're moving about the room and might be cooking, following a recipe or playing music. It's also a great feature for checking in on the dogs if I'm out.Now let's look at what's worse:1) Sometimes I find myself shouting at Alexa to even get her to hear me on this model. It can be very frustrating and doesn't work as well as the previous version. And even when it finally does hear me, it doesn't always get it right. I've changed the name on our devices to 'Ziggy' and the number of times she's played music by Ziggy Marley is extremely frustrating.2) The sound quality is good. I wouldn't say it's worse than the old model, but it's different and the bass isn't as punchy.Now let's look at what needs to be improved:1) Volume control - When you adjust the volume, the volume of everything is increased or decreased. I don't want Alexa booming at me when I'm playing music loud. She doesn't need to as whatever she is playing is reduced as soon as it hears her name so it can hear what you're saying. I've never understood why she needs to shout back at you when the music volume is automatically lowered! I want to be able to control the volume independently for voice responses, music, alarms and notifications.2) Personalisation - Amazon has a habit of creating very bland alarm tones, notifications and jingles (like the power on jingle when you start up a Firestick that sounds like tripping over in mud). Some of us would like to hear a futuristic tone, acoustic sounds, nature sounds, jazz sounds etc. I would like to make my Alexa my own, not what a megacorp decides I should like.3) Output - I want to be able to play my music through Bluetooth speakers, but I only want the music to be played through the speakers, nothing else... No Alexa voice, no alarms, no notifications, no recipe instructions... Just my music. Notifications and Alexa voice etc could still be played through my Echo but I'd like to keep them separate.4) Design - The design of the Echo Show 10 is nice but it's not very futuristic. The edge/bezel of the screen is still far too thick. The camera needs to move to a central point above the screen. There is nothing ""wrong"" with the design. It's just when customers buy an Echo, they buy it because it's convenient and also because the idea is still a little bit futuristic. It would be nice to see a sexy and sleek Echo device that looks as though it's come from  2050, not 2015. The whole point of Alexa when Amazon first released it was that it was futuristic. Back then it didn't need to look futuristic because the whole concept was. But speaking to Alexa is now a normal part of our lives so the look of the device is now even more important than it was originally.5) Privacy - I would really like to see much more on device processing.6) Video calls - I use videos calls 90% of the time rather than voice calls on my phone. I would use video calling on my Echoes too if the apps were available. It would be great to see more video call apps included with the Echo... Google Meet, Messenger, WhatsApp, Zoom and Skype.So am I glad I upgraded? Definitely YES. Using the new Echo Show 10 is nice, cleaner and the processing power increase makes a huge difference. But I'm just a little bit disappointed that the features, design and technology haven't really progressed that far. I've really only bought this upgrade as using Alexa has become a necessary part of our every day life in our household. It controls lights, TVs, plugs, music and much more. Our old Echo was showing its age and this new one is really only a small upgrade but in my opinion, the next version needs a pretty massive overhaul of some basic features and design to stay ahead of the competition.Update: I've had this a while now and everything was ok until it started showing adverts. I don't want adverts in my kitchen countertop. It's intrusive and cheapens the whole idea of having an Echo Show. As a result, I've now dropped my rating to just 1 star as the adverts haven't stopped. I won't be purchasing any more Echo Shows if this is what's happening from now on. Either Amazon is upfront and tells customers adverts are a part of a product or they should allow customers to get a discount if they allow adverts on their Echo device. Introducing advers AFTER someone has already purchased your product is a quick way for customers to lose trust in Amazon.",1,10/03/2024,United Kingdom
RC1NNKQ6X7KEQ,"I bought this Echo show 10 to upgrade my existing echo which now use upstairs and I'm really glad I did.It's so much more interactive and can be lots of fun to use, It also performs really well and I'm still discovering more and more things I can do with it like printing off recipes and shopping lists also colouring pages for the kids. it also links to my lighting and my door bell and shows me what's going on. I'm Really happy with my purchase although I think it could have been a bit cheaper.",5,21/12/2024,United Kingdom
R26MCU47KFPBOY,"It works as described, the sound quality is not as good as our other Alexa EchoIt would be nice if the advertising on the screen could be squelched down a bit, it's very intrusive - even when you give it access to your photos. It's almost as if this is the only purpose of the screen. This is supposed to be a premium product - not a concessionary model filled with advertising to compensate low cost - like the Amazon tablets....I bought this for the video calling features - which are shit. You are confined to calling in the Alexa app. Amazon need to throw some more logs into the server racks in the data centre. The quality of video calling is rubbish.Would I buy this again - no definitely not, not worth it for the price",3,04/03/2025,United Kingdom

R18P3J03JOJ309,"This Amazon Alexa Show 10 3rd Gen is a beautiful design , bad sadly It was not up to scratch at all. The Item came with 2 new software upgrades required and it then had to go through multiple on/off and download Install sequences before I could get it set up, I spent well over an hour on this sequencing. Finally when set up after about 2 hours, the Alexa interface was noticeably very slow. Responses would take a long time, this appeared indicative of a large system lag. This was not apparent or has ever been an issue on any of my other Alexa devices, which I then compared with on the same Internet connection. The Alexa's in my other rooms were all answering me while the Show 10 was still showing a blue voice indicator and no Alexa voice response forthcoming. Even just asking Alexa 'hello"" was lagging and even timing out, while the other units were all responding nearby in the other rooms.  I also found the motion detection to be too gimmicky and because the unit was so slow It became very annoying seeing it rotating the screen round while I just wanted communication, I switched this feature off , but it didn't improve the lag. I realise motion detection is a good adaptation for monitoring and reacting to the users position and remote camera access etc,  but it was not for me due to the performance lag. I persevered and tried other solutions including resetting and restarting my Internet connection, but it was the same,  far too slow.  I assume the cloud interface had too large a lag on my connection. I eventually had to give up, I I noticed some other reviews also mentioned a slow interface, but I thought this would not affect me, so I went ahead with purchase. In retrospect It appears these unit require a better and faster processor or they need excellent connectivity with the cloud to work without a noticeable lag. Hopefully a future Alexa Show 10 really addresses this issue as it was disappointingly poor and I had unfortunately to return the unit. I am now stuck with needing a satisfactory replacement and will have to live with my Show 8 units until a better solution or upgrade comes out from Amazon.  I want one that performs.",3,09/10/2024,United Kingdom
R7ZLGB9OOHQTW,"I've had Alexa products for years. This was an upgrade for me. Love the big screen. Love the speaker. Great value for money if you can wait for black Friday. I don't like the self rotating screen, but the can be turned off. Otherwise an excellent product.",4,05/01/2025,United Kingdom
R3IW46Y28O9QCW,"Love the screen size as I want it on my bedside to be able to drift off to sleep while watching podcasts etc. Only complaint would be the fact that the motion tracking turns itself off and says the lighting is too low even though the room is fairly bright, bright enough to see myself on the camera installed so I believe the motion sensors should be able to pick me up from a meter away.",4,03/12/2024,United Kingdom
RGFG89628OJLB,"Having used various Echo units in the past I had no problems setting up this new style unit. The set up is really a follow instructions on the screen exercise with you having to input your WIFI details to allow Alexa to crack on with things needed to ensure your up & running in no time. Name the unit & your up & running.Good quality screen give great picture depth & the sound is awsome. Motion sensor is a new gimmic & you do need to set this up via screen instructions, feels wierd the screen following you at first.So to sum up I'm very happy with my new Echo 10 so far but as you will notice I have only given it four stars.The reason for this is my product details in settings list my model as a 1st generation model not a 3rd generation model listed above? Also I cannot rename my unit from Alexa to another wake up name on this unit. I have renamed other units easily in the past & KNOW how to do it. So there we have it a good unit with a few niggling issues on my part.",4,21/07/2024,United Kingdom
R3RYUN55QXKZK9,"It could be great, but is ruined by adverts.Alexa's already useful, but being backed up by the screen adds that little bit of extra content that really enhances it. For instance being able to see a timer as it's active, or display recipes on it. Also, support for things like youtube and Netflix are great for playing stuff in the background. The only downside (apart from ads), is the lack of a real touch screen interface. You have to trigger pretty much every app/skill via voice commands before you can start I teracting with them on the screen.And that brings me onto the adverts. They are CONSTANT. It feels like every time I look over at it there's a new ad being displayed. If there isn't one for some reason, giving alexa a command will make sure to correct that.I can understand the occasional ad on cheaper echo devices to help pay for alexa's servers, but the amount being displayed is ridiculous, especially on a device that costs £250. Also, I feel like as a Prime member I shouldn't be seeing any. If Amazon needs more money, how about deleting that stupid AI chat bot which keeps getting in the way on the amazon shopping app; it must cost a load to run, and just puts me off using the site.",2,12/02/2025,United Kingdom
R28B5OWC2943SG,"The Echo Show 10 (3rd gen) is indeed an innovation that endeavours to harmonise the user experience with an appealing design. The advances from previous versions are notable and praiseworthy, albeit with room for improvements. To encapsulate the device's performance, it would be fair to say that its usefulness oscillates between being a shining star and a clouded afternoon. Let's get into the nitty-gritty.The UpsideFirst and foremost, it's compelling how the device attempts to synchronise with your movements - an effort that lends a sort of ""personality"" to this tech gadget, which in my case, managed to keep it out of the storage drawer (much unlike previous Echo Dots that failed to retain engagement). The 10.1"" HD screen that follows you around the room makes the Echo Show 10 a splendid company for video calls or binge-watching your favourite series on Prime Video or Netflix. Furthermore, the integration with smart home devices adds to its charm and utility, making tasks from setting up Zigbee devices to monitoring your home remotely a breeze.The Echo Show 10 also impresses with its audio output. The sound quality is top-notch, the speakers delivering a premium, directional sound that is perhaps the best amongst all the Alexa devices I've owned. The option to play TV series, music, and podcasts from a myriad of sources, including Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Spotify, makes it a versatile entertainment unit.The device's additional perks, like a friendly kitchen companion with BBC Good Food recipes or a digital photo frame with adaptive colour, are a cherry on top.The DownsideOn the flip side, however, the device's commendable efforts can sometimes falter, much like a cloud cover on a sunny day. The major letdown is the headline feature - the motion tracking. It can feel rather erratic and inconsistent, moving like a drunk at times, while at others, going completely AWOL in low light conditions. This issue seems exacerbated in certain room locations and under specific lighting, making the product feel a bit premature for a mainstream audience.The issue with responsiveness to voice commands when the music is playing is also noticeable. There were instances where I had to raise my voice to catch Alexa's attention.And lastly, the lack of app compatibility is somewhat disappointing, considering the device's potential as a central entertainment hub. Amazon should certainly work on incorporating popular platforms like Disney Plus.ConclusionAll things considered, the Echo Show 10 (3rd gen) is a solid addition to the smart home ecosystem and a worthy contender in the Alexa device range. The splendid screen quality, excellent sound output, and added features make it a delightful purchase. However, Amazon could do well to address the device's motion-related drawbacks and app compatibility issues. Therefore, I award it 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it to anyone looking for a versatile and dynamic smart home device, but with the disclaimer about its few quirks.",4,21/07/2023,United Kingdom
R2ARX1BK10WU6U,This is a great upgrade from my Echo Show 8 Gen1 however I have dropped a star because the sound isn’t quite as good as my old Echo show 8. I’m actually quite surprised as I thought the speaker on this new Echo show 10 would be quite punchy. It sounds a little bit flat.Great for keeping an eye on the dogs and 2 way talking.,4,26/11/2024,United Kingdom
R30R0XT37RSEYB,"Great product except for the sound issues. Media volume and sound is good but Alexa's voice is muffled and hard to hear. Unfortunately both volumes cannot be controlled independently. Fixing one causes the other to become unbearably loud or impossible to hear.This is a known issue that can be looked up easily but doesn't seem Amazon have a solution for.Amazon were great to deal with, they tried to resolve and when they couldn't they replaced the unit. The second until was even worse and went straight back.To be clear, I will be keeping the until as it is good besides this flaw. I have overcome as I use an external speaker for media, but at the price, that's not good enough.",3,10/01/2025,United Kingdom
R30RNSNZLNA6OP,We bought this as a central hub for use in the kitchen of our new Smart Home.It worked brilliantly for just under 2 years and then started to glitch.It would start playing games or starting skills or audiobooks in the middle of the night with no scheduled routines. I actually suspect it to have been an issue with the touch screen mistakenly detecting touches . When we called support neither they or we were able to determine exactly what was triggering the device to misbehave.Multiple wipes and reconfigurations were attempted and none were ultimately performing any different. It is a shame as it was a useful item ont he kitchen island and if in a video call it could track your movement around the room.We have since replaced it witht he latest Echo 8 (at our own expense) and the issues have all gone so was definitely a hardware issue on the Echo Show 10. Just a shame that Amazon never recognised it as faulty.,3,20/11/2024,United Kingdom

R73JG3ZHMSCD2,"Update 4 days later‐---------------So all the problems described in my original review ""went away"". Suspiciuosly, this happened just after an Amazon customer service rep tried to contact me, presumably about this review.  I say presumably,  as they'd just started to introduce themselves and were cut off, never to be seen again.Anyway,  I presume they force-updated my unit,  and all the voice commands are back. Look left, and look right really make a difference,  having some control over her movements makes a big difference!View camera now works,  and even from other alexa shows. You get pinch to zoom, and swipe to pan,  works very well.I'm withholding one star for the rocky start,  but if it all goes well,  i'll upgrade later.Original 2 star review---------The Good------------Camera is much improved, with a much wider angle view. The sound from the speaker seems a bit better than the last generation, but as I route music to an Echo Link, I don't really care. Screen seems about the same, possibly a bit brighter. The zoom is great when it's working.The Bad-----------The software is buggy as hell. This is not a finished product.I hope that sometime in the future they bother to do some QA, then release a final version of the software,  as it's pretty bad right now.On day one it would respond to request to ""Look left"" and ""Look right"" this is super useful when you are all at a table, and you want to get various people in frame. On day 2. Nope. ""I'm not sure"" or ""I don't know how to do that"" etc. If I didn't have witnesses, I'd doubt it had even been a feature. When ""tracking"" a stationary seated child, suddenly it will pan off to look in the opposite direction for no reason.""Stop tracking Me"" or ""Tracking off"" or every variation you can imagine of this now fails. On day 1 it worked fine. It's essentially like the voice part of the software has forgotten that the Alexa can move.Drop-in doesn't seem to work reliably with this one either. ie, if you are elsewhere and you use a show 5, it just goes to a ""drop-in"" static screen, and doesn't ever connect, mostly. Sometimes instead it just gives you audio.The Pan and Zoom are possessed. It's like you have a drunk cameraman with ADD. the shot pans and zooms all over the place. Sometimes it gets distracted and voosh, off pans the shot to something unrelated.Also the remote control from your Alexa app (to use it as a security camera), doesn't work. It just gave a static screen.So if the movement and zooming could be reliably controlled, this would be worth it, as it is, it's a frustrating product that's almost (but not quite) unusable. Is it better than the previous version? Well, if you grab the screen and override the motor, or possibly limit it's motion to nothing (which you can do in software), then you have a unit with a much better camera (which it needed) - but at great cost.Come on Amazon, you can get this right!",4,31/05/2021,United Kingdom

RCP5XLL63W7KC,"I also own a static Amazon Echo 10 and this revolving upgrade appealed. This is an initial review as I only purchased it yesterday. In almost every respect it is identical to my static Echo and compares favourably. However, I am very disappointed currently with the rotation. It responds every time to my voice, so that is good, but facial recognition is appalling. I have it on a pedestal drawer unit in a standard lounge with two ceiling lights. The facial recognition keeps saying it is too dark to operate. My room is perfectly well lit and when using Apple FaceTime I have no problems. I do not want to live under a spotlight and I believe the Echo leaves a lot to be desired. It cannot be beyond the wit of Amazon to have installed a camera and software capable of normal lounge lighting. The remote security camera and video calling work well. I will carry on reviewing the product, but if my opinion does not change I will be returning it. I will issue an updated review soon.Update - the Echo seems to have improved and begun to recognise me. Still no good in low light. Sometimes you need to say Follow Me to wake it, but if it is awake then it does follow ok. My opinion is definitely improving.Update 10 Feb 2022. Been using it for while now and getting used to it. Video and sound very good. However, it’s following software needs an update, it’s very hit and miss and requires excellent illumination. In normal lounge lighting the following is very poor.

R2GJFF3A3H16I1,"We bought this to replace our Gen 1 echo in the kitchen. We purchased this mainly for its screen size over anything else as we want it to display our ring cameras on demand and doorbell. so the larger size makes it easier to see at distance.The screen is ok at best, it suffers from alot of backlight bleed and seems to have higher than normal IPS glow. Obviously an OLED panel in this ‘always on’ scenario would be a poor choice but i wish Amazon sourced a better panel or implemented it better.Sound is great. Its not boomy or room filling to be honest but its slightly better than our gen 1 echo.The motion is gimmiky to be honest. You call for alexa and it turns to you which is great. But it takes way to long to reset back to your preferred ‘standby’ position and on the occasion alexa think your talking to her and your not (its the tv, another convo, odd sound etc’ it will just randomly turn in that direction and proceed to stay there. Quite annoying.I also wish the info on the screen was a bit more customisable. I’d like to be able to get weather, time, some news (actual stuff i feel is relevant nit what amazon thinks is) and some other info on just one screen panel, the size is now there so let us use it!For what we want it for (cameras mainly) it works fine and is a nice change from a screen-less gen 1 echo. But if your looking for a screen echo, dont waste your money here the 8 inch and a stand is £100+ cheaper and does exactly the same thing without motion, which you will get annoyed with after a few weeks.",4,19/04/2021,United Kingdom

I wouldn’t be without this wonderful piece of kit.",5,17/09/2024,United Kingdom

R3Q49XWYTTUZID,"This isn’t a good product. Why? It has its own agenda and it’s a way for Amazon to invade your home with adverts. Want it to show your photos and/or a prominent clock? You’ll maybe see this 10% of the time. The rest of the time it will be cooking suggestions, sponsored adverts, weather reports. YOUR shopping list. Yes, this thing will SHOW you what’s in YOUR shopping basket for the family to see. You have control over NONE of this. It shows you what IT wants to show you. You have no choice.It is also slow and clunky. I pulled out an original Echo Show from 6 years ago. Both are the same speed. In SOME cases the original is FASTER navigating menus!This is a bad product and a con. You are paying Amazon to advertise in your home.",3,11/07/2024,United Kingdom

RJK27BTZRAM75,"Thought it looked like an iPad on top of the first speaker Apple fetched out, but I decided to get one and I’m glad I did. It’s really good. I have ring cameras and it works well with them with the screen being bigger. You can see more and you have the screen follow you it’s great you just have to say Alexa and the screen moves to the direction you are in and the speaker sounds really good as well. I’m going to get one for the kitchen as well and you can monitor inside your home as well with the camera.It also has face recognition on as wellIt’s easy to set up, just plug it in follow the instructions that Alexa asks you can you open runningAnd also when is the new update it’s just hard if you are smart bulbs and the camera is on if no one is in the room turn the light off so it’s helping you just save on your electricity billAnyone who is upgrading from an echo show,8 second generation and as got one of the plastic shelves you do not have to get a new one. The echo show 10/3 generation fits on it fineI don’t know whether this is just the new update, I was listening to the radio while hoovering the Hoover was louder than the radio, so all of my for echo echo 10 third generation shows turned off i’ve got four of these now around my flap and everyone that comes into my flat they’re blown away with them and when I tell them if you pay the subscription with your phone company, there’s no messing about looking for your phone because your speaker knows where you are and the speaker you are closest to the phone call will go through to that one. I’m glad I upgraded from echo show eight",5,26/11/2022,United Kingdom
R3MKUU1MPWU9CK,"Echo Show 10: Where to begin? Overpriced & slightly underpowered, cpu can be quite sluggish at times but perhaps I was overestimating this device ?? Due to illness I'm spending a lot of time in my bedroom & I wanted a multimedia device to stream the usual streaming sites + my vast library on cloud. This device comes with Netflix & Prime Video, as you'd expect, but a huge miss is the lack of a DLNA support or a dedicated Plex app. I CAN access my Plex server but it wasn't easy. Remote access has to be enabled at server & if you haven't got a plex pass you're limited to 1mbps which only gives you 320p playback👎🏻 as it's indirect access. Plex pass allows 2mbps so your videos are 720p which isn't ideal by today's standards but it's acceptable. The website can be accessed via the Amazon Silk browser. Quality settings need to be set equivalently (see pic).Otherwise, sound & screen quality are very good, 1080p on Prime Video etc. The sound was very bass-driven for me & I've had to adjust it in settings.Motion.. Ah, if it was fine tuned, it would be great but I've had to disable it on my Show as it refuses to look me in the face & when I move to either side it moves the screen slightly away like a stroppy teenager who's been told off & refuses to look at you! I'm not even kidding.Overall, I do like the Echo Show 10 & I'm looking forward to seeing what updates Amazon can come up with for it.",4,18/10/2021,United Kingdom
R1HRCKH1DQC0YB,"Wanted to upgrade our older echo device's so bought a show 10 motion and a show 5.Voice recognition and response is much better, sound quality took a massive leap plus love having a screen, did have some issues with hue lights we had previously and had to remove and re install. Major pain in the A&#. Everything else was recognised and worked as before so I think the problem was down to Hue and what I've read confirms that.My Nvidia shield works by voice now, didn't with the previous unit.It's not all roses though, camera on the 10 tells me not supported so home monitor is not working. Mic on the 5 has a problem too and cannot find the settings to change it.And strangely our sound bar won't connect, it worked fine before.There no user manual, and don't buy the one on Amazon its crap. Only had them for a week or so and not had the time to delve deep yet so still a work in progress.It's a machine, so no way it's beating me, I'll keep ya'll posted.If your thinking about getting a show of any size I'd do it now while the deals are on.The 10 motion is still pretty expensive but I am confident there's more upgrades and performance to come with these, it a developing technology and will improve ( hopefully)",4,22/12/2021,United Kingdom
R3HJ49NQ71JQXN,I bought this mainly to display my photos. I’ve uploaded the pictures I want to display but this echo show has a mind of its own. It seems to play the same 25 pictures on a reel despite me uploading 130. The speaker quality is absolutely not comparable to the Sonos speakers I own. It also conflicts with the Sonos’s that are connected to Alexa.  I registered my husband as a user too and if we are both in the room at the same time the motion sensor goes rogue. I wish I had looked into this more carefully before I wasted my money. I should have just bought a digital photo display unit. So frustrated and disappointed.,2,24/01/2025,United Kingdom

R3VSM27M1J2219,"I’ve used this for around a week and initially I thought it was very good, screen tracking is great unless the room isn’t well lit. I’m impressed with the sound quality, the touch screen is a little sluggish but it isn’t a top of the range iPad etc it’s an echo. I purchased this specifically for the ring cam to come through into the living room and also to use as a home security being able to view the camera when not in, this in particular I’m very let down by, it rarely works and for the past 3-4 days it simply says it’s not available I’ve tried everything from resetting it, disconnecting and reconnecting from the Wi-Fi, turning off an on, all the settings I can think off but it simply no longer works! I’m really let down but this aspect as it basically was the reason I purchased. I’m hoping it was again work but it’s really frustrating having a piece of tech that won’t do what I paid for it to do and what it so proudly advertised.. I’ve since found out on Google this is a common issue with the device, so if you like me are purchasing it for this particular reason, I’d definitely reconsider.",4,02/12/2022,United Kingdom
R19S88L7QD7YQL,"Out of the box this was straight forward to set up and use. It was a little slow to respond during the set up but since then it’s been fine.I like that the range of movement can be set to the surroundings and a rest position selected. You can set up voices and faces to go with profiles so Alexa can recognise your face and voice. The speaker is rather bulky but music sounds good once you have set your treble and base preferences.The only thing I didn’t like/was disappointed with is that the black option came with a whole wire and plug. I chose black to fit in with my home aesthetic so the white wire stood out like a sore thumb. So much so I had to purchase a black replacement, not really what I wanted to do after spending a couple of hundred pounds.",5,22/07/2024,United Kingdom
R204IQP449J25H,"Brought one on a Black Friday kind of deal. Had I paid full price would have been really, really annoyed. Motion tracking is a joke... clunky and very hit and miss.Sound quality wise we went and brought a second generation 10"" show and could not believe that the quality was in our opinion awesome - particularly when paired with an Alexa sub... compared to this no base device. You can adjust the base but still miles behind its predecessor.. which is probably why Amazon still sell them on their website for more than the next generation.We were so impressed with the previous generation that we picked up second hand that we brought thre more to replace our second generation 5"" Echo shows and sold this one to a kid who liked the look but again in our opinion is easily pleased by what something looks like than quality.the screen feature looks cool but is overrated and in some parts less inferior than the old box looking non-screen moving shows.. Even the second generation 8"" echo Show in our opinion gives this a run for its money.If you want something that looks 'hi-tech' and that's more important than sound and functionality, then get this. If your more interested in sound and functionality than mouthing that looks 'hi-tech', get the second generation or if you have one of them keep hold of it. or get a second generation 8""Show as its a close runner sound wise and once again in our opinion functionality wise superior to one of these.",3,04/07/2023,United Kingdom
R2WVSZXR9S1OVR,"I recently purchased what was advertised as the new generation Echo Show 10 during the ongoing Black Friday sale for £179. However, I’ve encountered an issue with uploading photos from my phone using the Amazon Photos app. This device isn’t recognized by the app, so I went through all the settings in the Alexa app and on the device itself to troubleshoot. After investigating, I discovered that this is actually the first-generation model, despite being sold as the latest generation.Update: After contacting Amazon’s after-sales team, they resolved the issues with the device and even sent another Echo Show 10 to verify the generation. However, the replacement device also shows that it is an Echo Show 10 (1st Gen). Despite this, the customer service team has assured me that the device is the latest generation as advertised. Now I’m confused about what to believe or what steps to take next.",2,29/11/2024,United Kingdom
R2276BK1R9EU4H,Don't need to say much more others have already covered.my main bug bare with this echo show 10 is having to repeat yourself.all of my much much cheaper echoes are more responsive .I have tried everything to change this. volume level moving to different locations different heights.honestly save your money if your not bothered about motion tracking then go for much cheaper echoes .pictures good sounds good but honestly not worth the money.amazon need to some serious software updates for this unit.infact my echo flexes at £5 are 100 times more responsive am going to get rid of this as it is so annoying having to repeat yourself.will get much cheaper show 8 especially the offers can get four show 8s for the price of this.dissapointed is an understatement.dont buy.,4,08/11/2023,United Kingdom
R2D81D8W6FHYB8,"I have had echo dots for a few years now, and decided to go for a show to display our WiFi outdoor cameras.

R2GJC0BBFR98H0,"Like: Screen quality, moving screen/camera during calls, sound quality better than original show.Dislike: Recurrent adverts that are impossible to turn off depite googling for possible solutions (I will never look at another shark product again). When you feed back that an advert is not wanted, it will tell you that it will be hidden, then promptly shows it again and again and again interrupting photos etc. Unlike previous models, video from security cameras appear in a tiny window in the corner of the screen that requires you to manully expand to be reasonably visible (again, no option to alter).Conclusion: Unfortunately the bombardment of adverts (not seen on my older Echo Show) is so intrusive that I cannot recommend this product and I wish I'd not exchanged my older device.  To anyone visiting, the Show 10 appears to be a an advert for Amazon shopping and, in particular, a certain brand of vacuum cleaner.  If you Google this issue you'll find many customers with similar concerns and there is nothing in the product description that mentions this. Keep your older Echo Shows. I shall be returning this new device.",2,06/10/2024,United Kingdom
R1II9QZN3WAFV7,Purchased this to replace the original Echo Show (which is still going strong after 10 years) as the screen is bigger.

Looks nice and modern on the kitchen worktop.,5,13/10/2024,United Kingdom
R3R6CA9BM9H067,"This echo is absolutely fantastic, the screen quality is equivalent to a top end TV, the sound is superb and it’s a brilliant addition to any modern kitchen.Be very careful, during set up, be sure to activate tracking so that it follows you, also be very careful when you’re setting up profiles and make sure it knows everybody in the house by face, also control the rotation carefully so that it doesn’t bump into anything.Also, during dropping or video calls, it’s a good idea to not run around, give it time to recognise your face and try and move as gentle as you can and it will always track you and my daughter regularly tries to make it lose her and rarely succeeds…All the people that say that this doesn’t track you either haven’t set it up properly or are expecting too much of it, keep redoing the set up to make sure you get it exactly right, and if you can use it while facing the camera, you’ll have the best experience, Amazon are really not out the part for this device, especially at this price point during Blackfriday",5,07/12/2023,United Kingdom

R51SNRRABHCW9,"Right, don’t get me wrong, I love this item, but it’s not amazing, not sure I think it’s worth the money.Looks wise it looks great, the screen has a lot of bezel considering other tablets, but that’s not off putting.Sound is really good, to me, however I have noticed a little distortion on higher volumes at certain bass frequencies, but again, not off putting and for me, a massive jump from the google nest hub o had prior.The tablet is rubbish though, it’s slow and unresponsive. If you imagine a sub par android tablet, then you won’t be disappointed, but an iPad it isn’t. It does Netflix and prime easyish, although Netflix didn’t work out the box until I manually searched updates. And YouTube is just a bookmark to the webpage, it doesn’t even do Disney plus, which is a real shame. I’m not sure about prime but the google hub does the rest, with no webpages or workarounds, just opens the app. So overall the table is a 2/10 for me.It controls my home really well, if not better than google did however the google app is 100 times better, the Alexa app is a little confusing and isn’t the best for families as you all need separate profiles otherwise Spotify doesn’t work properly. But if you all have separate profiles you have to tell Alexa to switch profiles, even though it knows who it’s taking to. And the devices that I as the account holder have already intergrated don’t auto pop on other peoples profiles like they do with google. These are more gripes with Alexa as whole though and not the device itself but for a family, ease of use definitely goes to google again.Overall, although my review seems really negative, I still love it and am really enjoying my purchase, it’s just I kind of wish the device was made by google.",3,27/02/2022,United Kingdom

After blowing my top a few times my poor wife found a way on an American company and connected it that way. Now it will turn on and off but that's it, can't ask it to do spot cleaning or anything technical. A lot of our TV's and other gadgets won't connect to this Alexa either, would've thought it might be because of out dated gadgets, but a lot of our stuff is brand new and should connect.

RWF1AI5MQ7MT7,I’m new to Alexa so it’s been an experience.. Iv had more arguments with Alexa than I did with my ex.. She can be a right royal pain in the…. Having said that.. Sound quality is pretty good.. Lots of bass which I had to tone down a bit. The “follow me” thing can be a bit irritating.. I sometimes think she’s been at the old vino.. I’m nowhere close to getting the best out of this atm and have had continuous issues setting things up (She hasn’t got a clue how to run my TV for example) And I was being forced to listen to Amazon music until I realised I could change the settings. I think a lot of it is just learning how to use the thing but it’s not as easy as you’d think. Also Broad Yorkshire accents are not her favourite 😂 So far Iv just used it for Spotify and watching podcasts on YouTube whilst I’m cooking but I’m hoping to have a fully functioning smart home in the future as I’m disabled and making life simpler was the whole idea behind getting this.,4,29/01/2022,United Kingdom

Silence!  Sometime later it may actually do what was originally requested.  It's infuriating but especially that  my mother knows that in times of difficulty / distress / or a fall she can simply ask Alexa to call me.

RX3QCJXRHS27E,"We have been waiting for this to launch since last year when it was first announced.However delivery from Amazon is nearly an 8 week wait from launch but we managed to purchase this same day from Argos.We already have the Echo show 8 & 5 and the main reason we wanted to purchase this was the added benefit of motion detection and being able to check in on the house via the camera when we are not home.Overall it’s a great unit, the sound is incredible and the motor that enables movement is completely silent.Motion detection is incredibly accurate as it uses its camera & microphone to sense where you are standing but it will only work 100% in good light conditions and if there is more than 1 person walking about it can get ‘confused’ with which person to follow.Depending on where you wish to place the unit, you can set the movement parameters so it will not hit anything when motion detection is in use.You can also set a default position for which direction the unit will face when not in use.However it is slightly disappointing that the screen tilt can only be changed by hand as we wanted this to be able to monitor our dogs - on a hip-height table it’s is unable to view the surrounding floor inside a 10 foot perimeter.For anyone with Ring devices, this works seamlessly with the doorbell, floodlight, indoor camera & home security alarm kit.Also works well with controlling Hue lighting, Hive thermostat & Dyson Pure hot + cool fan.",5,27/02/2021,United Kingdom

I had also heard that it was wonderful for zoom calls.Nope!!  Zoom is only available in the US so not available in the UK with no indication it might come anytime soon.  My mistake for believing amazon reviews and not checking where they were posted from though.As for recipes? with no browser you are limited to whatever apps interact with echo shows - at first it was ok as the BBC Good Food app worked and I like their recipe then that was removed and it left me with predominantly US recipe apps that I didn't like and didn't have the right measurement info for.  I don't use ""cups"" for cooking or baking and this is what I was left with.I think you are so limited by the availability of specific apps or you have a large and very expensive echo dot that watches you move around the room (you can switch this off) but for me its just not worth the cost over a normal echo dot and definitely not worth the space on my kitchen worktop.  If there was a browser it would have been worth persevering but 9 months is long enough and I'm getting rid of it.Unfortunately the BBC app was removed more than 30 days after I bought this so I can't return it either.Overall very disappointed and will think much more carefully before buying anything other than a basic echo in future.The quality of screen is decent IF it does what you want AND the apps stay available - it did neither for me.",2,15/08/2023,United Kingdom

R12MGJOX0PMHKG,"I have had every Echo device except the Dot, so you might say I’m a fan.  I do like the new Echo Show and I love the idea of motion but it is quite unreliable.  When you say the wake word, on occasion it turns in too far or completely the wrong direction.  At other times, when you’ve finished with it, it does not go back to its resting position so you have to get up and turn it yourself or adjust the settings.  This happens too often.  On other occasions, it just turns, out of the blue, when the wake word has not been used.  The motion however, is very good when using the Echo Show camera to look in on your room or to make a call and following you then is mostly accurate.  The sound is very good  with a lovely bass sound, particularly useful for reggae music.  All the other Echo Show features work well so on that basis it does not disappoint. I would expect that over time, with updates, the motion feature will work well.  At least that is what I am hoping.",4,16/06/2021,United Kingdom

The display quality is good, and the sound performance meets the high standards associated with the Echo line. The integration of Alexa, as always, makes it convenient for managing smart home devices, checking the weather, and other routine tasks.However, my main concern was the speed of the device. At times, I found it to be a bit slow in responding to commands and navigating through menus.

R210VUTKIERE43,"In general, very satisfied, good sound, quickly reacts to commands, in the presence of good Internet, but there is one huge disadvantage - the camera. since it is located not in the middle, but in the right corner, the display unfolds to the person not directly, but with a distortion to the right, so that the camera itself is located opposite the face, as a result of which the display itself always mows to the left, which is very annoying.",5,10/07/2024,United Kingdom
RRSVGMBK9R7LN,"There were lots of good reviews but some bad ones that made me nervous. The good news is that Amazon are good taking things back so took a chance. Didn't need to worry, easy to set up, works perfectly. Great picture quality, great sound and the screen follows me around the kitchen which is cool!Its a heavy piece of kit, looks and feels quality.Automatically linked to my other Alexa devices and Ring doorbell.Loving the ""Drop In"" command that allows me to video call other devices.Very happy.",5,14/06/2024,United Kingdom
RTXI0LNWR1QMJ,"I got this for my desk setup as it looked like a great device especially to tie my smart devices together. The follow me feature can seem a bit creepy at first but you get adjusted to it very quickly. Being able to watch Netflix, YouTube and prime video is great. Although, I do wish there were more apps that were compatible such as Disney Plus. My family thought it was crazy to spend so much on a smart home device, and I will say it is a bit of a steep price but if you use Alexa for more than just a handful of task a day I personally would say it is worth it. Even they understand the usability of it now. Only one thing I have noticed is that when music is playing(not extremely loud) and you call Alexa due to the screens position at different angles it doesn’t detect your voice over the music as quickly as the normal echo does. That is the only thing I could possibly fault about the device itself. But it could be down to my rooms acoustics too.",5,14/06/2023,United Kingdom
R16AHE40V4CYEX,"I've had mine quite a while, I'm very pleased with it, the best feature for me is the screen follows you around the rom when you drop into someone  I like the bigger screen than on my Echo Show 8 second gen and my Echo Home Hub.I will be buying another one to replace my Echo Show 8 2nd gen in the kitchen.I'm pleased I brought it on Black Friday as I saved myself £100 off the price even though it was only just released when I brought mine.The screen is bright I just wish you could change the theme like you can on Amazon's Home Hub.",5,22/02/2024,United Kingdom

R3FE0UDKDOMHHT,"I have a lot of echo devices, since the first generation which i preordered all those years ago, and this is THE worst device for microphone pick up. I review the activity on this all the time and report the poor performance and still years later it frustrates me to the point of leaving this review.DO NOT BUY THIS, as simple as that. It is near useless. The show 8 is far superior in microphone pickup and every other non screen device is superior to this. My guess is the rotation of the screen is hindering it's microphone pickup as I have never had such a poor echo experience.I can be mere millimetres away and this couldn't make sense of what I say, in fact numerous times multiple other devices have carried out the command even though they are in different rooms. I really can't stress how poor this device is.If you need a screen of 10 inches then get a fire tablet with mount. If the size isn't important then get the 8 inch and if a screen isn't important then get literally any other echo they sell. This one is rubbish!!! And I love my echos and my smart home that I made echo the centre of so that is how bad this device is.",1,04/10/2024,United Kingdom

R103C6KFDAL3JK,I had owned the Echo Show 10 for about a month before returning it. The tracking around the room was not great and would not always follow me around the room. The sound quality was not the best and the audio sounded flat like there was barely no bass to the sound whatsoever. Sometimes my voice is not recognised or is misheard on what commands I had gave the device. I had come from the Echo Show 8 2nd gen and in my opinion the sound quality and microphones were so much better on that device compared to the Echo Show 10 3rd gen.,3,03/01/2024,United Kingdom
R1Z0ROOISY7T5V,"After purchasing a new 65 inch TV for the lounge, we decided to put our old 55 inch TV in the bedroom.  We wanted to put it on the wall as it was too big for our current TV unit.I researched various wall brackets from budget to higher priced items, but in the end decided on this bracket as it had such great consistent reviews even though it was currently listed at an amazing price of £12.00.  Another draw was that it would be a close to the wall fitting which was important as I didn't want to be able to see too much of what was behind the TV when walking into the room.It arrived the next day in a very small box, and it included every needed for a neat installation.  Several different VESA screw sizes and various spacers to suit different size TV's.  It all felt very sturdy and well made.  There were also some wall fixings, but not suitable for my hollow plasterboard wall, but I knew that as the advert clearly states not for use on hollow walls.  This is clearly down to not being supplied with the correct fixings, but I already had these at home ready.The bracket was very quick and straightforward to fit and even included a small spirit level.  I gave that a try, but it was not very accurate, so I used my own spirit level instead.  The bracket has a tilt adjustment which I had to set right back as I did not want it leaning forward, so it is now perfectly parallel to the wall.  It also has two pull cords to enable easy removal of the TV from the wall bracket.I was so impressed with it that I purchased another one and we now have the old 40 inch TV from the bedroom on the kitchen wall and it looks great.I can highly recommend this bracket as being very sturdy and easily coping with our 55 inch TV.",5,15/06/2024,United Kingdom

Although it says don't install in just plasterboard, with the correct fittings, it's not an issue. I hung a 43 inch and 32 inch on the walls and they are very sturdy, the quick release toggles are a great feature, they hang from under the brackets slightly so if you're into aesthetics, they can be tuked away.

R2V0AFBIN56KWA,Good value for money and feels solid but personally found it hard to get the tv onto the bracket.

R1RSGV1VCCWQJ0,"I wasn't sure when I opened the box to be honest. It looked a bit small.But I needn't have worried. It was just a lot smaller than the one I had been using before. It has a fairly limited angle on it - so ignore that ridiculous picture showing it hanging off the wall at a huge angle. It won't do that, but why would you want to anyway?Easy to install into a solid wall (which are easier to do, I know). The mounting plate is not wide but it's OK to mount the TV on to, if you are careful and have put the mounting brackets on the TV properly. Lots of fittings are provided & I found the right ones for my TV with no issues. Make sure you use the spacers and put the brackets on the right way round (left and right). There is no spirit level provided so you need to have one of those already.Overall it does a good job of hanging a big TV on a wall with the right tilt, without it sitting away from the wall at all. This is a plus, but also a small negative & my only one. As it has a very low profile, access to the back of the TV is very limited. This is OK if you are not planning to change your connected devices too much. But it could be a problem if you need access to the back of your TV a lot.If a sleek, low profile design is what you are after then you have found it. If you are looking to plug things in and out of your TV all the time, move on, this isn't the one for you.I'd buy it again. Thanks for reading.",5,19/11/2021,United Kingdom

RYB52W6RN0J01,"The ninja dual zone Air fryer has a huge 7.6 L total capacity. There is two individual baskets which are 3.8 L each. It has six programs, which are Air fry, roast, bake, dehydrate, Max crisp and reheat. If you are only going to use one of the baskets then zone one is the default zone to cook with, but what I particularly like about this is that for instance you can air fry at 200° in zone one for 30 minutes and you can roast in zone two at 180° for 20 minutes at the same time by pressing sync and then start.  This will start zone one and when it reaches the 20 minute timer zone two will come off of hold and start roasting. If you remove the basket such as for chips to give them a shake, then the timer will pause until The basket is re-inserted and if both zones are cooking it will pause both timers. The other option that I really like which is nice and easy and can maximise your output if you’re cooking the same thing, For example if you had to Air fryer 1.5 kg of chips. Then place your chips in both baskets and on the zone one display enter in your temperature timer and press match then start. This will duplicate all of the information to zone two, Which makes it easy and super efficient. The max crisp is set at 240° and this is the only function that The temperature can’t be changed, and it could be set to a maximum time of 30 minutes. The air fryer function can be set between 150 and 210° and has a time range between 1 minute to 1 hour. The roast function allows you to use the ninja as a conventional oven which has a temperature range of 120 to 210° and has a timer that can be set from one minute to four hours. The reheat function has a temperature setting of 130 to 210° and can be set from 1Minute to One hour. The dehydrate function allows you to gently remove moisture from meat, vegetables and fruits. This temperature can be set between 40 to 90° and has a set time of up to 12 hours allowing you to create healthy snacks. The bake function means that you don’t have to wait the usual 10 to 15 minutes that your conventional oven would take to pre-heat Which is perfect if you just want to knock up a quick dessert. The temperature setting is 120 to 210° and has a time range between 1 minute to 4 hours. This ninja air fryer is super easy to clean, compare to my previous Tower Air fryer baskets. Overall we are very satisfied with our purchase as it has so many functions, Not just an air fryer. I hope you have found my review helpful.",5,17/07/2021,United Kingdom
R28N87XKCTTK8A,"The best thing about this product is that it pays for itself through energy savings  Since getting this Ninja my deep fat fryer is now obsolete, my grill is almost obsolete and my oven hasn't been used since.This product cooks great chips but one does have to learn a little first.  When cooking chips it's critical that one folows the instructions and washes the potato starch out before air frying them otherwise they will burn.  Next one needs to work out the times and temperatures for different potato varieties  as cooking times do vary between the different types.  Once one has a good idea of the cooking times and temperatures chips are quickly produced in the air fryer.Although the air fryer works well there are the other options available; Roast, Bake, Dehydrate, Max Crisp and reheat.  As the saying goes, ""practice makes perfect"" and it certainly applies to this Ninja.  One has fun messing with this product as one tries to find the best and most successful way to cook food.  Roasting duck breasts is a typical example.  I have cooked them with the Roast option but I have found that they cook best by giving them 8 minutes on Roast followed by six minutes on Max crisp to get the skin well cooked and crispy.As  my images show, this ""compact cooker"" roasts some great chicken quarters.  The same applies with the chicken as it does the duck, partially roast the chicken and finish off using the max crisp setting which operates at 240c and that is 10c higher than domestic ovens so it cooks and crisps skin perfectly and quickly.I have used this Ninja for toasting garlic bread slices and it does it much quicker and much better than my Solarplus grill does so that is something exceptional.As this Ninja has much smaller cavities than a domestic oven it can rapidly heat up, that is how it works.  When cooking there is no need to preheat the Ninja as the cavities reach their temperatures in a matter of a small few seconds and that is where the energy savings come into play.  By not having to pay to preheat a large cavity domestic oven ones uses much less energy thus one isn't paying the 30p+ per kWh for an element that requires a 3.6+kWh input.  If one has a cheap cooker then it's cheap for a reason... it needs more energy thus it would probably use a good kWh just to preheat the oven so one can easily be paying 40p to 50p just to warm the oven up.  A more expensive cooker, like mine, can have triple glazing in the oven doors thus they are much more enrgy efficient and save money when comared to cheaper cookers.  As the Ninja only has to heat up a small space the food is cooking almost immediately and it does cook evenly.I did mention duck, chicken and garlic bread but what about roasting coffee beans?  I did think about it and after doing a little reading online I tried it.  I don't advise using this Ninja for roasting coff beans as it does become ""expensive"".  Many people claim that one can get a ""dark roast"" in six to eight minutes, with others claiming it takes around 15 minutes.  Well, I don't believe any of them have actually tried it as even after a good 1/2 hour the beans were only light roasted.  To get a dark roast will tale close to one hour at the highest temperature so that becomes costly for a small amount of coffe bean.  One can invest in a domestic coffee bean roaster but personally I do prefer to do it the traditional way, which is much more cost effective.  One simply puts the beans into a pan (frying pans are good for this) or a traditional roasting pan that imported.  Next, one simply heats the pan on a high heat hob or gas burner for a few minutes.  Whilst the beans are roasting one simply stirs them around from time to time.  A light roast, like what the Ninja produced, can be obtianed in only two to three minutes with a dark raost taking around five mionutes.  What the Ninja produced in 1/2 hour would have taken me around 10 minutes and I would have got two small batches of dark roast for my espressos.So, this Ninja is excellent for cooking almost anything but there will be the exception such as my fresh green bean coffee.It is so easy to keep clean so that is a very good bonusOne thing I did note from some negative reviews is that some reviewers gave negative ratings and claimed the product is fauly because ""lots of steam"" was coming out.  Well, I can honestly say that is not the case.  The problem is not with the Ninja but is with the user.  During my second use of this I seen some steam coming out and instantly worked it out that the pan hadn't been insertred correctly.  When using the Ninja it is important to insert the pans flush so that they are firmply sealed with the machione otherwise steam will escape thus cooking will be uneven and will take longer.  As soon as I seen the steam I simply pulled pan number one out a bit and reinserted it thus no more steam.  Another issue with those that cook with incorrectly positioned pans is that apart fromcosting more to cook the food and not cooking the food well... it will dry the food.The steam from the cooking food is part of the cooking process and helps keep the food moist but losing the water will mean the food, especially meats, will go dry.Overall I am impressed with my Ninja and I should have bought one much sooner than I did as it is saving me money, it is saving me a lot of time and most importantly it produces some excellently cooked food.  One day I will risk it and try to make some jam in it and maybe even dehydrate some fruits.  If successful thenit will mean my dehydrater will become obsolete aling with my deep fat fryer.I am recommending this product as it is made to a high quality standard, it works very well and with the energy and cost savings this is very good value.",5,07/09/2023,United Kingdom
R29ISKJFBYJ1ES,"This air fryer is absolutely fantastic! It has so many amazing features that make cooking so much easier. You can air fry, roast, bake, and reheat—it’s like having several appliances in one! The crispy results are perfect every time, and it’s great for making healthier meals without sacrificing taste.One of my favorite things about it is that it’s dual—you don’t have to wait for one dish to finish before starting the next. You can cook two dishes at once or make larger quantities of food in one go, which is super convenient, especially when cooking for multiple people.I’m really impressed with this air fryer and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an efficient, versatile, and easy-to-use kitchen appliance!",5,09/03/2025,United Kingdom

R2P5OSR7PMYLRC,"So far everything i've tried has cooked very well and within times given. Simple to use, quicker than normal oven. Easy to clean especially when used with silicone draw liners.",5,19/03/2025,United Kingdom
R1LXIJB7USUB6E,"We have never had an air fryer before but went for this one as it has a large capacity and has the dual draws which seemed great for cooking a lot of what the kids like to eat.You get a easy start up menu and a full manual with recommended temperatures.The manual is easy to follow and you can get started straight away. We purchased additional silicon inserts. Recommend the inserts as they are easy to clean.There are six settings air fry, max crisp, roast, bake, reheat, dehydrate.There is no recommendations in the manual for the foods listed to what setting you chose. You need to do this.First meal we cooked was 2x vegan Kiev and 2 portions of chips.Vegan kievs normally take 25mins at 180 in a fan oven. Chips 15 mins at 180 all once the oven has reached the temperature.I Set the oven on air fryer mode and set same times and temperature as for fan oven.Using the sync feature I was able to start cooking so they finish at the same time.I decided to keep my eye on how everything was going so I didn’t burn anything.After 18 mins the kievs appeared done and the bread crumbs crisp so I checked the chips which still had 7 mins left and they were just starting to crisp but were a golden colour.One thing to note is if you have over done the cooking time on one item but sync the trays you don’t have the option to just have the other tray still going unless you empty the tray and run the clock down on the empty tray. Otherwise you can turn off and reset the timer on the other tray which is what I did as it only takes a few seconds. Note if you open one tray you shut down the cooking in both trays when using the sync feature.I switched off and set the time for 3 mins on the fries. The fry’s came out perfectly crisp without being burnt but only took 12 mins.The second meal I cooked was 2 vegan pukka pies. You can get two pies in one tray. Cooking time 25 mins at 190 in the fan oven. Pies cooked in 18 mins on the bake function without a soggy bottom.The cooking time could possibly been reduced a few minutes. This was all again straight off so no warming up needed like our fan oven.The only thing we don’t like about it, is it radiates heat more so than the conventional fan oven. The kitchen felt very warm. Also although we have heat detector in the kitchen we have a smoke detector in the hall. Every time we cook the smoke detector in the hall goes off yet none of the food is burnt.The only comparison to this is when you have certain bread in the toaster you get some smoke which isn’t visible to the eye setting the alarm off.We have cooked fry’s so it may be the oil coating them is getting very  hot too quickly. We will need to experiment with reducing the temperature but increasing the cooking time. This will save closing the kitchen door.So be prepared to experiment on times and temperature etc. be prepared for a hot kitchen.Be prepared to cook food which tastes better than the oven.Be prepared not to have to wait for your oven to warm up.Use inserts and get wooden tongs as the inserts get very hot and it can be awkward to get them out the tray.",4,09/09/2023,United Kingdom
R1RDB7FSWKNBS,"I've been using the Ninja Foodi Max for a while now, and I can confidently say that it’s the perfect addition to my kitchen. This all-in-one cooking device has not only streamlined my meal prep but also saved me a significant amount of time and energy. The versatility of the Ninja Foodi Max is unparalleled; it’s essentially an air fryer, pressure cooker, slow cooker, and grill all wrapped into one sleek machine. Whether I’m roasting a chicken, pressure cooking a stew, or air frying some crispy fries, it handles every task with ease.One of the first things that struck me about the Ninja Foodi Max is how great it looks on the countertop. The modern design and compact size mean it doesn't dominate the space, yet it still packs a lot of power and functionality. Despite its compact design, it has a large capacity, making it ideal for family meals or batch cooking without taking up too much space. This balance between size and capacity is something many other appliances struggle to achieve, but the Ninja Foodi Max gets it just right.In terms of energy efficiency, the Ninja Foodi Max is a game-changer. I’ve noticed a decrease in my energy usage since I started using it. The combination of quick cooking times and efficient heat distribution means it consumes far less energy than using a conventional oven or stovetop. For instance, meals that used to take an hour or more in the oven now take half the time or less, thanks to the combination of pressure cooking and air frying. This not only saves energy but also significantly reduces the time I spend in the kitchen.Cleaning up after using the Ninja Foodi Max is a breeze. The non-stick, dishwasher-safe parts make it incredibly easy to clean, which is a huge plus after a long day. I appreciate that I don’t have to spend extra time scrubbing pots and pans, making the whole cooking experience more enjoyable from start to finish.Overall, the Ninja Foodi Max has exceeded my expectations. It's perfect for anyone looking to save time and energy without sacrificing the quality of their meals. With its stylish design, space efficiency, and ease of use, it has quickly become an indispensable part of my daily routine.",5,24/08/2024,United Kingdom
R1775UO5T273PV,Great product and easy to use. Its a fair size so make sure you have the room for it. Cooks food quicker than an oven. Looks quite good as well! Our microwave doubles as a small oven so we rarely ever with on main oven so its cost saving too.,5,19/03/2025,United Kingdom
R1297VDG5ZGY4S,"I thought now I've had it nearly a year I'd leave a review. Firstly go BIG to start with. Forget the smaller units, if you can afford it, get the large capacity Fryer to start with, then you won't have to upgrade and loft the smaller one. For energy saving it's a winner. We have a large Bosche oven and hob, great when energy was cheap, but now since we are retired and electricity prices are criminal they're impossible to run without breaking the bank. Cooking is now SO FAST! No more oven warm up, no longer waits, it's terrific. It does everything it says on the tin!Now the bits to watch for, not bad, but take note:-1) There are three of us at Christmas, and we had to use the cooker and hob for all the food as the Fryer was not big enough, you'll never do it, even with this bigger unit. It's lovely to use the cooker and hob a couple of times a year- Doesn't hurt!2) You'll need to use the Fryer combined with a Microwave, you'll get meals prepared much quicker, it's a winning combination. Works great for us.3) Be sure to get the silicon tray sets that insert into the drawers, keeps everything super clean, fast wash up, and they last a long time. Just be sure to wash everything up thoroughly, and a good wipe round. Our unit still looks brand new!4) When the drawers are hot after cooking, close them properly, don't leave them part-open. I've read the heat can delaminate the front fascia.(Ours are fine so far as we abide by this rule).5) The coating on the feet nodules (under the front of the drawers) wears off after many openings and closings, and ours have scratched our glass stand-alone hot plate. (Not a problem as easily replaced). But if you put your Fryer drawers down on your worktop BEWARE as they will scratch any surface.*Use an old, clean tea towel or heat proof mat to protect your worktop surface.6) Purchase a heat resistant Mat set (here on Amazon). Put the Fryer on those, when not in use the Fryer slides easily out of the way - Amazing!*We purchased a wooden hob cover, then two mats, then the Fryer on top. (We pulled the cooker and hob fuse in the circuit breaker box to be extra safe).So there we have it, what are you waiting for? Recommended 100%.Brilliant.",5,30/01/2025,United Kingdom
RGV5ODJP2NPVT,"I have had this product for almost 19 months and used it daily. A month ago it developed a fault in that only Drawer 2 side would work. For Drawer 1 it would accept the settings but the heating element and fan did not work. I decided finally to call Ninja's customer support (on a Friday afternoon). Connection to a human was almost immediate and they did a video call where I showed them the machine. To my delight they offered to send a new replacement minus the 2 drawers. They told me it could take up to 5 days. On Saturday, I went to a pre-arranged meeting with a friend only to find on my return that DPD had tried to deliver the replacement. It was delivered at lunchtime on Sunday. Excellent service from all involved. Thank you very much.",5,03/03/2025,United Kingdom
R1MADITESFH7SJ,"I do like a Ninja product but I had not purchased a Ninja air fryer because to be honest I thought it’s all about the name and how can it be that different from any other air fryer. Well….we did have a cheaper, one drawer air fryer and it did do the job but we used it a lot and found that it really was not big enough. It has gone to a good home and now we have this and we are thrilled with it. I thought it was going to be over complicated but it isn’t. We use it daily and we do use the ‘sync’ and the ‘match’ functions. Originally we bought an air fryer because the kids would put the oven on for a chicken kiev and a few fries and it was such a waste of energy. We use this more than the oven because it has the capacity and it is easier to accommodate everything in two drawers. It’s here to stay and I do not regret spending the money. Easy to clean too, which is always a bonus.",4,09/02/2025,United Kingdom

R3UR23TG9HL9JL,"It's trial and error at the moment. However, I'm really pleased with it. I haven't used max crispy yet, but the crisper plate gets things crispy anyway. Frozen chips and frozen hash browns come out lovely and crisp. I particularly like that you can use the two drawers (at the same time) at different temperatures and timings. I find that it takes about 5 minutes off of the normal cooking time. I bought the silicone baskets that are for the ninja dual zone. Make sure that when you're using the appliance, open a window. Would definitely recommend this model.",5,02/03/2025,United Kingdom
R3ORI8XI7JRBII,"Love this.  So pleased with it.We had a simple air fryer to start and quickly 'outgrew it'.  We love the sync option that allows you to use both drawers simultaneously and it turns the second drawer on at the appropriate time.We bought silicon drawer trays too to help keep it clean, but actually the drawers clean really well in the sink.Looks good on the work surface. Have met so many other people now who've said ""I've got one of those"".Happy to recommend this - I think it is worth the money - just check that you have the worktop space for it though - it is large.",5,01/03/2025,United Kingdom

I think it was the very first time I really tasted eggs. It was the purist state of them I’ve ever experienced.Fast, Clean and unaffected by any cooking oils or the like. Even using something Teflon coated.And having the facility of the two trays working either in unison or delayed function is a game changer for my cooking experience. I might still be a lousy cook but the Ninja will do its best job to make every one of my disasters at least eatable.I will make one suggestion however…The instructions were I’m quite certain written for quantum physicists. Go onto YouTube. There you’ll find very ‘easy to understand’ tutorials.And in the booklet supplied there’s a wide range of food types, times to cook and what degrees to set.If you share my experience, you won’t be disappointed.",5,09/01/2025,United Kingdom

R2LYVLAK02Z1FE,"If kitchen appliances had a superhero league, the Ninja Foodi Max Dual Zone Air Fryer would be the undisputed leader. This thing is so good, it practically has a cape hidden somewhere in its sleek design.Imagine, if you will, a world where crispy fries, succulent chicken wings, and perfectly roasted veggies coexist in harmony, and all without the guilt of deep frying. That world exists, and it’s sitting right on my kitchen counter. I call it the “Ninja Zone” and it’s every bit as epic as it sounds.First off, let’s talk about the dual-zone magic. It’s like having two personal chefs working simultaneously. Need to cook your main dish and side at the same time? No problem. One side can be sizzling away with juicy chicken breasts while the other is lovingly crisping up sweet potato fries. It’s a culinary tag team match made in heaven.The speed! Oh, the speed! This air fryer is faster than a caffeinated cheetah. My formerly chaotic dinner prep has transformed into a well-orchestrated symphony of deliciousness, with me as the maestro waving a spatula.And don’t even get me started on the clean-up, It’s so easy. Honestly, the Ninja Foodi is like having a top-tier chef and a cleaning crew rolled into one shiny, efficient package.In conclusion, the Ninja Foodi Max Dual Zone Air Fryer is not just an appliance—it’s a kitchen revolution.

RE12AZ58FGSCV,"It's nearly been a year that we got it and we hardly use our oven now..you can do everything that can be done in an oven and more. It cooks much faster and saves so much energy. It has loads of functions. The twin basket can used with different settings thus cooking a full meal at one go.. since it's a dual basket it big if you have small kitchen and no counter space.And don't forget to turn your food in-between cooking, that's a must when using airfryer.",5,24/01/2025,United Kingdom
R335S8PJZ3T809,"I wasn't sure whether to give a one star or five star rating for this product.My reason for contemplating a one star rating was due to the fact that after 14 months of operating perfectly, one of the compartments suddenly failed to heat anything. and i assume the heating element must have burnt out.However after speaking to the Ninja Support people i changed my mind and feel that they deserve a five star rating.Ninja Support conducted an online troubleshooting process with me and concluded that the unit had failed. As it was still covered by their guarantee they agreed to replace it and, surprise surprise, i received a brand new replacement unit (minus the drawers) the very next day! From making the phone call to Ninja and receiving the replacement unit was less than 26 hours. Remarkable service!I would add that Ninja offer a one year guarantee on this product but if you register it with them within 28 days of purchase they give you an additional year's guarantee which in my case was invaluable as it was 14 months after purchasing that i had the problem with it.Well done Ninja!",5,30/08/2024,United Kingdom

R8URH6SPK7J1D,We bought this to tide us over whilst we renovate the kitchen and have to do without an oven.It’s well built and looks higher quality (less cheap looking plastic) than some of the other cheaper options. It’s light enough to move around and the compartments are light but sturdy.Cooking is extremely easy with the quick select function buttons and the ability to change the times to suit. Roast potatoes in 15 minutes was a nice surprise. The compartments are easily big enough to fit good sized portions. There is only two of us but could quite easily cook for 4 with one compartment.This will take up a good amount of space on the worktop but is arguably worth it.,5,30/12/2024,United Kingdom

RRQO8PZ2D67B0,"I bought this as I am going to be having surgery on my hand, and needed something that would be easy for the older kids to make food. I must admit was skeptical at first, but Oh my goodness, this thing has been the best ever thing I have bought for my kitchen. Saves time, amazing 100% excellent Quality make and build. I do not know why I didn't invest earlier. Best ever item I've purchased. I am in love with it, I've already cooked tandoori chicken, baby small potatoes with herbs, peri peri chicken fillets, wedges. Perfect. Not noisy at all.",5,10/01/2025,United Kingdom
R35WDGX3UWE6TD,We were wondering if we would use an air fryer despite everyone having one. Bought it at sale price and so far it is fabulous and I've used it every day .. maybe because I'm experimenting .. but really recommend some multi- level shelves to double the capacity in the drawers and I got silicone egg poachers and drawer liners which make a great omelette. The Ninja is easy to use and looks differently in each drawer or the same. Works out quicker than the oven and cheaper to use.,5,15/12/2024,United Kingdom
R2H9VJFKXLAYFB,"I’ve always had an air fryer as I find they cook chips better than an oven, my old Tefal Actifry left a lot to be desired as it would constantly squish anything that wasn’t a chip.My old air fryer was starting to show its age with the nonstick coating starting to scratch and the discoloured plastic so it needed to be replaced.At first I was sceptical at paying nearly £200 for something that would effectively be used to cook chips however after a fair bit of research I decided to bite the bullet and order the Ninja.The first feature I like about this air fryer is the dual zones allow me to cook two meals separately, not only that but both zones are physically separated from one another meaning I can cook meat in one half and cook a meal for my partner who is meat free in the second compartment.This leads into my second favourite feature, the “sync” option, it’s unbelievably convenient to be able to cook two separate items with different cook times and have them finish at the same time.Speaking of cook times, this air fryer is a record breaker, so far everything I have cooked has been for roughly half the recommended times, I.e. chips in my old air fryer were 18-20 minutes, in the Ninja 9 minutes is plenty.Max crisp is also a highly recommended feature, for example using this setting I have cooked battered onion rings to a level that would rival a deep fat fryer with this mode.I have experienced a few occasions of soggy food, however I’ve put this down to user error by not allowing room for air flow between food items or shaking the drawers halfway through cooking like recommended.One accessory I have found invaluable for this has been a digital temperature probe, mainly due to the fact it cooks so fast it helps to have a way to verify the internal temperature, I.e. I had cooked some burgers that on the outside looked perfect, however their internal temperature was lower than expected.Physically the footprint of the fryer is small compared to competitors offers and to be honest it doesn’t look terrible left out on the worktop. One point I would like to note is during max crisp I have noticed a large amount of condensation on the wall behind the fryer, this may factor into its location.During operation the fryer makes a reasonable amount of noise, not loud enough to warrant shutting the door to hear the tv but loud enough for you to know it’s there, I’ve recorded one drawer operating at around 62 decibels which according to Google is the volume of a normal conversation.I think at some point in the future it would be handy to invest in some accessories such as the silicone liners, just to make cleaning that little bit easier. Speaking of accessories I have found tongs to be a must-have for this air fryer to safely remove large items from the drawers, tipping food out is also an option but any oil/grease that has pooled in the bottom will end up on your plate too.In summary the performance of this air fryer is, in my opinion, unrivalled for the average household, it cooks everything I have thrown at it to perfection and has nearly made my oven redundant.",5,09/07/2024,United Kingdom
RUUIAJS7FMWUK,Great functionality and quiet. Make sure you but some liners though .,4,16/01/2025,United Kingdom
R1Q1F5CORV4BC7,"I was reluctant to join the crowd on this one. I have to say I’m converted and it’s my daily use now. Plenty room for food. I personally use to prep my meals for the next few days and get 3 chicken breasts in each tray, which takes about 18-20mins. I’d recommend a meat probe to go with in case they need a couple extra mins. I haven’t overcooked the chicken yet and have delicious juicy chicken most days. The kids prefer the chips and sausages made in here too and I have to say so do I. Cooking is made much easier.The device itself is easy to use and clean . I found the guide book it comes with useful too. It is quite big so make sure you have the space but other than that great bit of kit.If you’re on the fence about getting one I’d recommend taking the plunge.",5,30/09/2024,United Kingdom

R306OPTRDSB1WM,"I've been late to the Air fryer party, mainly because i've seen too many epic fails online and I was resisting conformity for no rational reason. But due to recenly becoming more health conscious, I've been looking for alternative ways to cook healthier versions of the tasty fried foods we like with a lot less oil. So I bit the the proverbial bullet and just hurled myself onto the bandwagon. I am generally quite pleased with my purchase.First thing I would say is that it is pretty powerful/heats up quickly which can be a blessing and a curse. It has taken a bit of getting used to balance the amounts of food vs cooking temp and time ratio without over/under cooking. The guide is a starting point to get the settings right but is not foolproof and yes I have carbonized a number of things (chips became wingnut-esque). However when you practice and start to ""trust"" it a bit (check/rotate through the cook) you can whip up meals mid week that you would probably only have time to do on the weekend with conventional methods. I don't use the dual function too much, I cook more in the giant ""megazone"" and bought this model mainly for the bigger draw size so that there is space for the air to circulate, rather than trying too cram too much food in a small space which leads to uneven cooking. Only thing I miss from this model is being able to just take out the draw and shake contents which you can do more easily with single/small draw models, so I may get another smaller one for that reason if I manage to magic up some some counter space somehow.Finally, this was on a deal when I bought it so I feel I got good value for money. I think Ninja makes quality stuff.",5,29/04/2024,United Kingdom
R3T0WCEYG2NPQT,"I won’t repeat the features this Ninja Air Fryer has, as many previous reviewers have already outlined them. What I would say about this machine is that it is perfect for two people. For instance, take a simple meal such as Pukka pie & chips. 2 Pukka pies will fit perfectly diagonally in one of the trays. Enough chips to feed 2 people will be a simple thing to cook. 2 supermarket breaded / battered fish fillets also fit nicely sided by side.Once you add in a 3rd person, things can get tricky. Adding a 3rd pie or fish etc. to the mix means you will need to position them on their sides to fit, which also means they will need regular turning to avoid the part nearest the heating element in the top of the unit browning faster than the rest of the pie/fish.Adding a 3rd portion of chips will also mean constant shaking of the tray and to be honest, you will still probably end up with a few chips that haven’t browned and are still a bit raw. Trying to turn them with tongs or a wooden spoon just ends up with broken chips.The instructions do warn you about overfilling the trays however, but don’t expect to get a lot of food in each tray without a lot of ‘shaking’.Am I still happy with the Ninja? 100% yes! You just have to learn what is possible to get the best results.Start by cooking small portions and you’ll soon learn how far you can push the quantity side of things. Cooking for a family of 4 means you would probably need to cook in batches, which might not work for you as keeping food warm in your main oven sort of defeats the object of an air fryer.You can cook all sorts of delicious stuff like Peking crispy duck, Tempura king prawns, scampi, steak, chicken breasts, fabulous baked potato etc. etc. all cooked much quicker than a regular oven.Hope this helps.",5,01/03/2024,United Kingdom

R3URGTO074REEI,I know that the product information states that the power cable is short for a purpose - to prevent dangling power leads and children pulling the hot oven on top of them. But - at 78 cm it is just too short to reach the correctly positioned socket from the best position for our air fryer on the kitchen counter.A bit penny pinching to not supply a power lead that is at least 1 metre long. Please trust the owner to install this in a safe position - add all the warnings you feel necessary to avoid legal action but make the power lead longer.  I bought a simple extension lead of 0.5m which solved the (uncalled for) problem.,4,14/12/2024,United Kingdom
R31HRVOQ567R78,"We absolutely LOVE our Ninja air fryer! Since we got it, our oven has been gathering dust because we use this for almost everything. From crispy fries to perfectly roasted veggies and even juicy chicken, it handles it all with ease.The design is sleek and modern, and it blends beautifully with our bronze kitchen accessories—it looks like it was made for our countertop! Not only is it functional, but it also adds a touch of style to our kitchen.Delivery was lightning-fast, and everything arrived in perfect condition. If you're on the fence about getting an air fryer, trust me, you won't regret choosing a Ninja. It's efficient, easy to use, and makes cooking fun and healthier.

R3LZBTD1HN5Z7R,"Don't get me wrong, I really love this air fryer. It does everything I want from it and more. I think I'm what they call a power user. Not just chips and sausages, it does soooo much more than that. You just need the imagination to use it properly. From other comments I've seen, sadly some people just don't have that imagination. Pies, lasagne, pasta bakes, jacket potatoes, toasties, roast potatoes, hunters chicken, haggis, grilling with marinades, fish (simply the best at cooking fish!)... the list goes on! Air fryers (or mini oven/grills as I prefer to call them) are definitely the way forward, along with Ninja multi-cookers! And that's without the very significant cost savings in electricity over standard ovens.The Ninja air fryer does more than many others... dehydrate, prove, bake, roast, max crisp etc. And if you break anything, you can get spare parts for them!However, there are a few tiny issues that they probably need to sort out. Firstly, the fan is a touch too fast and can't be manually adjusted, which means that any coverings, such as silicon sheets, get whipped to one side. It has even whipped the cheese off my cheese on toast before the cheese has managed to melt. But that can be worked around with a bit of imagination.Another minor issue is the lack of a viewing window. I found this really useful in my previous fryer.Another tiny gripe is that the controls/programming seems a bit daft in places. For example, there are separate temp and time controls for the left and right ovens, but you still have to select which oven you're adjusting. Also, you can't cancel/override the sync and match controls without cancelling the whole thing. There are a few little niggles like this with the controls. Nothing serious, but suggests a lack of real cooking testing.But overall I can't complain. I'll still buy another one when this one burns out.",4,15/07/2024,United Kingdom

R1N7AOCWY9EQML,"Previous to buying this item, our household had a small egg-shaped air fryer which was bought buy a family member as a moving-in present. We used this egg-shaped air fryer for years and always found it had issues where by the food at the bottom wouldn't cook as well as that at the top. We desperately wanted a Ninja Airfryer and so after saving up and ordering, we couldn't wait for it to arrive. On the day of its arrival, we were quick to put it to use and we couldn't believe the improvement in quality from our previous air fryer.FIRSTLY, the size improvement is the first advantage. This air fryer can hold so much and it isn't even the biggest you can get on the market. It has enough space to cook two different types of food and also with accessories can be used to cook more foods at once.SECONDLY, the quality of the cook with the item is far superior. It has a definite better airflow to it which means that the whole compartment of food is cooked properly no matter where it falls in the compartment, meaning no reduction in taste or texture no matter whether you get to plate your portion up first or last.THIRDLY, the amount of settings which the item has is much better. The item has sync, duplicate and other features which allow you to time your different foods which had different cooking times so that they automatically set off to ensure the finishing time for cooking finishes at the same time. There is also the duplicate feature which means that you can just copy the settings to the two compartments. There are also options to crisp up food with more or more traditional air fry, also dehydrate to make cocktail garnishes, I have yet to experiment with this setting but know people who have and they say it's great.FOURTH, the quality of the item is great, sturdy, and bulky which gives the impression of a good quality item, and we have been using it regularly for months and it has yet to show any signs of wear and tear.",5,05/06/2024,United Kingdom

R2TC00XEN3SWQO,"Originally purchased when had to move to temporary accommodation whilst renovations carried out on our home. Fantastic piece of kit. Since getting it we hardly ever use the oven as the Ninja can cope with just about anything. Have made everything from curry to cakes with great success. Plenty of online groups to help with adjusting from big oven to the Ninja. Various settings to choose from, just use as described. i.e. Roast, Air Fry, Bake etc and you will soon learn how to adjust. Generally the time in the Air Fryer will be shorter than it Ould be in conventional ovens. Is the probe necessary? Depends on how confident cook you are. If you think you can judge cooking meat just by time then no, you could go for the lower model but, if you wt to get it ""just right"" then the probe can prove to be a very useful tool.  TIP: we always use silicone liners as it makes it very very easy to keep the unit clean in addition you can get a wire tray to allow you to cook on two levels if you want.",5,24/10/2024,United Kingdom

R2LTIH53ZOPZJT,"The reviews didn’t lie. Excellent air fryer. It cooks food really well (making them really crispy) and cooks quickly. This was the largest size. The only downside i would say is that while the capacity is large, food cooks better in a single layer but that means you can’t fit much in. If you fill the drawer then you have to be very patient, cooking food on a lower temperature and constantly turning the food to make sure it all cooks through. Slightly annoying if you’re cooking for multiple people. It’s also a little loud. However, we are really enjoying the air fryer and would recommend it.",4,05/01/2025,United Kingdom
